He diagnosed me with hypercoagulation and put me on Lovenox shots for two weeks, then transitioned me to Coumadin six weeks ago.

At the beginning of this year, I had a bad cold, and two weeks later, I had a tingling in the wrists, feet, and legs, which the doctor said was reactive arthritis which lasted a few weeks. Then, the first time my left hand felt weak was five months back. It felt weak, more so at rest but, when I had to grip things, I was able to. I went to a physio and had a neck massage as my back was also tense and the next day, the weakness was gone. So, the massage helped it. Now, more recently, I had foot weakness on the left side and a weakness and very mild tingling in hand. Again, my back is very tense and tight from gym and work position. As soon as I get this, I get very anxious, and I feel the tingling gets worse. The only difference in daily activities is lifting weights at the gym, weighted squats, and heavier arm exercises. I used the foam roller on my foot last night, and today the foot weakness was gone. The foot weakness lasted 12 hours on and off. There are no problems walking or anything like that. It just felt weaker but, it was not. The weakness always comes randomly but, I do seem to always have a tight back when the weakness occurs as well. Could this be MS? Does it sound like it? I am extremely worried now. I have never been diagnosed with it. I have just read about it online. What could this be from? I went to the opticians last week, and my eyes were fine. There were no eye symptoms.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am taking tablet Alprazolam 5mg (three tablets, a total of 1.5mg) at bedtime. I do not take any Alprazolam or any other benzodiazepines during the day. Also, I started taking Alprazolam about 6-8 months ago. Originally this was for a short period of insomnia due to a life situation where I was so worried about life that I could not sleep. The situation has long passed, and everything is fine now. I would like to slowly wean completely off of the Alprazolam so that. I no longer will take it. I am also being treated for bipolar depression, and I no longer feel depressed at all. But somehow, other benzodiazepines with longer half-lives such as Diazepam, Clonazepam and Clorazepate make me feel quite depressed within an hour or so of taking them. Actually pretty much any benzodiazepine besides Alprazolam makes me feel depressed. So, it seems like I have to wean off of the Alparazolam without substituting longer-acting benzodiazepines. I will go from 1.5mg to 1.25mg for a couple of weeks, then down to 1mg, then 0.75mg, etc., until I am not taking any anymore. At any rate, I am not sure if I am having interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day. I do not think I feel anxious, though I am not sure exactly what anxious means, to be honest, even though it is such a common term. I know I do not really spend much time worrying. I generally feel calm and at ease in life and about life. There is really nothing to worry about life because everything is going well for me. But perhaps I *would* be feeling more interdose withdrawal-related anxiety were it not for the antipsychotics and antidepressants I am taking. Perhaps they're ameliorating the anxiety that would have been there during the day between my evening alprazolam doses. But I have noticed lately that I am somehow a bit emotionally labile, at least when it comes to dealing with situations with my girlfriend. It is like she does something little that upsets me, something which I would ordinarily perhaps feel a bit poorly about or get a bit emotionally stirred, and ordinarily we would potentially have a conversation about it to solve this issue, or perhaps we wouldd get into a small fight or something. But lately when something happens which upsets me, it really, really upsets me. I can get easily angered or have some other odd negative emotional reactions. I wonder if this is a problem of interdose withdrawal from Alprazolam? It is possible, too, that it is just a development in my psyche, some kind of psychological problem only manifesting recently. But I wonder if it is possible, too, that I am having this experience as a withdrawal symptom between bedtime doses of Alprazolam. I can be in a perfectly good mood, or in a great mood, or in a normal mood, and one little thing happens with my girlfriend and everything is terrible all of a sudden, I feel terrible and I end up making her feel terrible. Have you heard of anything like this in terms of emotional lability/reactivity or anger or irritability something like that as a result of benzodiazepine withdrawal? Also, if I wanted to test this idea out and divide my bedtime alprazolam dose into, for example, three doses of 0.5mg each, is it possible that I experience insomnia as a nighttime withdrawal symptom? What I mean is that I only had insomnia for a short period due to some anxiety in my life, but that anxiety is over. But now, if I forget to take my 1.5mg alprazolam at nighttime, while I do no start worrying about anything, I just cannot fall asleep. And oddly, if I do start to fall asleep, I am suddenly sort of shocked/jolted back into being awake. This is not the type of insomnia I was being treated for where I just could not sleep because of worrying. I no longer worry or have much to worry about, and I think if I were not dependent on the Alprazolam, I would be sleeping just fine without it. I might be having trouble making this subtle point: It is that while I cannot sleep without my 1.5mg bedtime dose, I do no think it is due to an underlying insomnia, but rather a result of my being dependent on the Alprazolam for sleep after all these months. Is this is possible because of 6-8 months of use? And especially is the feeling of the insomnia is super different than how it was before. Before I just worried and could not sleep, but now there is no worry, I just feel awake in an odd way and cannot sleep, or if not, then I half fall asleep and suddenly startlingly awaken before I am fully asleep. So, now I am thinking of spreading my dose out, and instead of 1.5mg at night, maybe I would take 0.5mg in the morning, 0.5mg sometime later in the day, and 0.5mg before bed. If it is the case that I am experiencing insomnia as a consequence of my dependence on the drug, then would it be probable that I experience the same rebound insomnia (or whatever it is called) when I spread out the drug? That is, when I spread it out throughout the day and night, should the level of the drug in my blood be enough at nighttime that I do not experience this rebound insomnia? So that if there is some kind of insomnia at nighttime (during this experiment), it is not because of my Alprazolam dependence but rather due to an underlying insomnia? I wonder because I would not want to try this if you think it is probable that I would still have this rebound insomnia. I would only do it if the idea of it makes some sense to you. That is because I am only prescribed enough for 1.5mg per day, and the doctor is not willing to give me some extra during this period, so I have to be careful not to waste any if at all possible so that I'm not missing nights of sleep. Of course, if there's no way to know unless I try it, then I'll try it. But I would only stay away from the experiment if you think it does not make sense. So, if my brain is used to having 1.5mg at bedtime, then even if I took 0.5mg in the morning and 0.5mg in the afternoon, would I still need a whole 1.5mg at bedtime even though I already took 0.5mg morning and 0.5mg afternoon? Would my brain expect the whole amount at night because that is what it is used to, or would it accept that I already had 2/3 the dose morning and afternoon, and so the other 1/3 could be taken before bed? And finally I just want to say that I would like to try this because I am concerned that:1. This emotional instability is an interdose withdrawal symptom.2. The longer I am on the drug, the stronger the dependence gets so that it becomes more likely that I develop more severe interdose withdrawal symptoms during the day like panic attacks or something.If either of these are possible, then it would seem like a good idea to spread the dose out in order to avoid these things.Please explain.", "faq": "I would like to gradually reduce the dose of Alprazolam.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I need a detailed medical advice regarding my son's medical condition. My baby was born on the 19th last month, but he was premature. He was born at 29 weeks. His birth weight was 1.26 kg. Due to his preterm birth, the baby was in NICU for 45 days and got discharged. During birth, he had RDS and a surfactant was given and later supported with CPAP for five days. Feeding was done with OG tube and slowly shifted to oral feed after 25 days (spoon feeds). Initially, he had feed intolerance, but he is fine now. NN jaundice was diagnosed and phototherapy was given. At discharge advice, weight: 1.89 kg, height: 45 cm, HC: 30 cm, breastfeed on demand, spoon feed every 2 hours. Medications: Caffeine 9 mg (now stopped), multivitamin drops (D3 and A to Z), Domstal suspension 0.5 ml, iron supplement 0.4 ml.As of today, he is 65 days old and his weight is 2.42 kg. In the last 24 hours, he is passing more liquid stools and not like a paste. His usual pattern is one to three stools per day. But, in the last 24 hours, he pooped at least 10 times and most are a bit watery. He is exclusively breastfed. No formula is being given. Is it a sign of loose motion?

Spoon feed he is taking but that too not as expected. He is passing urine well. My concern is whether he will drink enough milk when put on the breast? What should be the pattern to follow?

I went to an orthopedist and was given some medication and wrist brace with metal support to stabilize the movement. The pain started declining for six months, but it did not go. I did an MRI for it, and another orthopedic surgeon recommended PRP injection with a month cast as he could see it as a partial TFCC. After the injection and one month cast, 15 sessions of physiotherapy, the pain persisted, so another MRI was done to check the progress.The MRI comparison showed the following:A comparison was made with the previous MRI.The previously noted and described reactive bone marrow edema in the medial corner of the proximal lunate is progressed and also showed mild diffuse edema involving the whole lunate bone. I would highly suggest further follow-up for the lunate bone to exclude the possibility of lunate bone avascular necrosis.Minimal reactive bone marrow edema noted in the triquetral bone.The stable appearance of the lunotriquetral ligament with preserved joint space.Stable central and ulnar side intrasubstance TFCC signals with no evidence of major TFCC tears.More prominent joint fluid, especially in the recess around the ulnar styloid process.Slightly more prominent ganglion cyst measuring 4 mm noted in the dorsal aspect of the wrist at the level of the radiocarpal joint.No lunate or perilunate dislocation.Normal flexor and extensor tendons.Intact carpal tunnel and median nerve.No bony fractures.I am concerned about the avascular necrosis as the doctor mentioned we should wait another three months then reconduct the MRI to identify the need for surgery bone drilling and another cast for six weeks.It is now ten months, and I am losing most of my right-hand function, and I do not want to reach the final stage of my lunate bone dying.

Query: Did my GP prescribe the right meds? I mainly suffer with social and performance anxiety (talking to people, talking in groups, meetings at work etc) for the past 10 years. My voice breaks when I talk and I have a chronic dry mouth from stress/anxiety every day (even when off meds). I worry and overthink alot about what others think of me. I've tried amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant) when I was in my early 20's (im 30 now) and also tried Lexapro and Zoloft in more recent years but they didn't do much for me and gave me alot of annoying side effects. I have tried beta blockers too. For the past 2 years I've been medication free but every day becomes tougher and tougher to get through due to symptoms of anxiety. I wouldn't say I have low mood or depression. I have tried benzos also and I did abuse them for a few months and had to go through a horrible withdrawal. I haven't touched them in over 2 years. My new GP recommended I try Lyrica (Pregabalin) and wants to see how it goes for a couple of weeks in battling my anxiety. Im starting on 25mg once daily and moving to 50mg tomorrow or next week which is a low dose. Does this make sense to try with my history? I have a chronic dry mouth from chronic stress and anxiety and most drugs make my mouth way worse. The doc also mentioned possibly trying amitriptyline again too if Lyrica doesn't work.

I have been having some serious anxiety issues from thinking and worrying about this.I have been working in a restaurant for the past one month and been using a backpack to hold my work clothes. The inside of the backpack did not appear or smell dirty, but it has been used for various purposes before. For example, on a few occasions I had used the backpack to go to the gym. I put my workout clothes in a plastic bag first, so I never had dirty clothes touching the inside of the backpack, but I had sometimes put the plastic bag on the changing room floor while changing before putting the plastic bag back in the backpack.I am now really worried that the inside of the backpack was contaminated with some dangerous pathogen, meaning that my work clothes became contaminated, and hence, when I occasionally touched my clothes, I transferred some of those pathogens to my hands.

Four years ago, a German shepherd of my friend's scratched my hand. The dog died one and a half years after he bit me. I was scared but calmed down a bit as a dog cannot live very long.

He said that if I got bitten in the future, then I do not need to have extra doses of post-exposure prophylaxis.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I have a non-itchy but painful penis rash. I am a 47-year-old unmarried, not-sexually active, uncircumcised male, 5’10”, 190 pounds. I have a history of ulcerative colitis (which seems to be hereditary). This was corrected 12 years back when I received a total colectomy and pouch replacement (that is bowel removed, and new bowel constructed out of small intestine). That seems all good. For some time (five years), I have experienced a very slight pain or irritation at the base of the glans of my penis. Friction (eg., masturbation) would make it sore, but it was very slight. Some redness in the skin just below the glans, but not always. Did not even consider this a problem (and it might not be the problem, I am just mentioning it).Six months back the glans of my penis became inflamed. This was the start of my problems. No bumps, no itchiness, no scaling skin. Just redness on the bottom half of the glans, and also the tip. It got very sore. If it was never touched, it does not hurt at all. However, it rubs the underwear during the day, and that can be very painful. Not always, but most of the time. The pain can be excruciating. I want to emphasize that the rash has never been itchy. Urinating causes no pain. I consulted my family physician and he did not know what it was but said he could treat it like a yeast infection. So he prescribed some antifungal cream with 1 % Hydrocortisone (Clotrimaderm) and when that did not do anything, suggested the 1 % HC might be getting in the way, so prescribed straight anti-fungal over the counter anti-fungal cream (all the creams I have used twice a day). No help. The 1 % HC did relieve some (a little) of the pain but did not actually fix anything.Thinking maybe the problem was not fungal, but perhaps bacterial, my doctor then prescribed Polysporin ointment. I quite by accident bought the version of Polysporin with Lidocaine. The Polysporin also did not fix the problem, but the Lidocaine brought some relief! The pain was lessened, but as I said, the problem was not fixed. I used Lidocaine for two weeks before going back to the doctor to let him know the problem remained. He then recommended a urologist, so I got a referral to a urologist. The urologist did not know what it was but suggested two possibilities: go see a dermatologist or get a circumcision. My family doctor did not think the circumcision would help, so he referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said the rash was non-contagious and non-cancerous. He prescribed me four creams which I was to try, in sequence one at a time, for a week at a time, and let him know which helped. They were Ketoderm 2 %, Fucidin 2 %, Noritate 1 %, and Hydroval. I tried each of these as directed. None of these helped. The ones with some HC 1 % relieved some of the pain, but the rash is currently as bad or worse than when the problem started. The dermatologist said there was nothing else he could do, and recommended I get another appointment with a different urologist. The dermatologist did a swab and sent it to the lab, and it came back negative. He also had earlier said it was not an STI.As you can imagine, I am not very encouraged. My doctor does not seem to know what is up, and neither does the urologist or dermatologist. Can you give me some suggestions as to the cause and the remedy for my rash?", "faq": "What can be done for non-itchy painful rash in penis?"},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,My lateral incisor #7 fractured at the gumline and will likely require a surgical extraction. Also, while a temporary filling was provided after removal of pulp pending a root canal, the root canal was not done for many months due to an insurance lapse, and the tooth became infected as well as surrounding bone. I have read that some dental surgeons advocate for the removal of the periodontal ligament during extraction to facilitate healing and the proliferation of new bone cells, and that this must be done explicitly with a bone burr. I have read that this is common practice for biologic dentists and biologic dental surgeons, and uncommon otherwise. My Med-Cal / Denti-Cal providers are not biologic dentists.I have four questions. 1) How important do you think the complete removal of the periodontal ligament really is? 2) If the extraction is surgical vs. simple, is it likely that the ligament would be removed anyway? Perhaps because some extra surrounding bone may need to be removed? 3) If removal of the tendon is not standard practice by the dental surgeon, can I request it and would they know what to do and not be offended?, and finally 4) If an implant is contemplated, would the region of the removed tooth and perhaps some surrounding bone immediately be packed with a bone substitute for socket preservation? Or would the infection need to clear first?", "faq": "Kindly explain whether periodontal ligament removal is important during tooth extraction."},

It was also determined that tooth 18 needed a root canal but was not going to be certain to work and I may end up losing that tooth.For financial reasons, I opted to have tooth 18 pulled five days ago in hopes of helping the severe tooth, jaw and ear pain that I am having.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am a 31-year-old male (165 cm height and 101 kg weight). I had panic attacks and permanent tension headache for the past six years (pressure on the head), unbalance, dizziness, anxiety, worrying about the future, mood swings, and chest pressure. Then my psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD and panic attack. So, he put me on Seroxat and Lexotanil for seven years which made a huge positive impact (all the symptoms were gone approximately, but the only side effects were that I became less energetic and gained weight). Now my new doctor is telling me it is too much to take high doses (Lexotanil 3 mg three times a day) and Seroxat (20 mg three times a day) and it has been too long on them. So he wants to cut off Seroxat and Lexotanil and put me on Wellbutrin XL.So I have decreased the dosage of Seroxat gradually for 10 mg a day which caused withdrawal symptoms but now (after two weeks), it is better but I did not decrease the Lexotanil because I felt I cannot. But now the doctor said to start with Wellbutrin. He wants me to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg the first day without Seroxat, the next day Seroxat 10 mg without Wellbutrin, (a day on day off) like that for two weeks. Then to stop Seroxat permanently and stay on Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. He preferred to decrease Lexotanil as much as I can but he wrote on the prescription 1.5 mg three times a day with the Wellbutrin XL.My questions are is there any interaction or any problem between Wellbutrin XL and Lexotanil if I take 3 mg Lexotanil three times a day with the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg? Is there any interaction between Seroxat and Wellbutrin if I took them a day on day off (as I described before)? Is the Wellbutrin XL effective for my case as my previous medication (Seroxat and Lexotanil) or not? I have started the first day of Wellbutrin XL 150 mg and I took with it, in the morning, 3 mg Lexotanil, then at the noon and night I took 1.5 mg Lexotanil, but I was surprised before sleeping at night I had a laughter attack with no reason.

I realized my mistake was the drastic change in eating habits and calorie intake and not so much the less eating since when I first got the period I ate very little in general. I have stabilized my weight and eating habits for about two months and still no period. I am extremely worried that I may become less fertile or even completely infertile because of this. What do you suggest that I do in order to get my period back? Also, some days ago I decided to try herbs, more specifically Vitex agnus-castus, for 3 or 4 days and even though I have not read online anything about side effects I got eczema on my arms.

Now it is the third time and it is a mild case on my arms. I know that I will have to consult a dermatologist to get rid of the eczema but I felt like you had to know this in order to give me more accurate advice.

The earliest stage is white spots on the teeth, where cavities or decay would form and when your mouth is exposed to a lot of acids it can eat away your gums and loosen your teeth. So, I think that, from throwing up in my mouth almost 40 times a day, my teeth are getting translucent and I have four white spots on the front teeth.

I should have ovulated on 7th and my period should have started on 26th, however it did not. Yesterday, when I wiped there was a stringy, slimy discharge tinged with orange and I started getting mild cramps not quite as strong as menstrual cramps.

I have just spotted a little, which are not enough for a tampon or a pad and not enough to really fill a panty liner.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 34-year-old male in good general health. Until 20 years of age, I never experienced any issue with erections or sexual health. When I turned 20, I had an episode with my girlfriend where over two consecutive nights, we had no sex, but rather very prolonged foreplay. Due to the prolonged arousal, my erection stayed for most of the night, without ejaculation. This episode of two prolonged erections and arousal obviously hurt my penis as it went through some visible changes back then, both in shape and feeling. While it was not painful, it lost some thickness and the side erectile tissue eventually lost some elasticity, becoming somewhat hardened in a flaccid state. Since a slight curvature initially appeared, I can only guess this was Peyronie’s.Eventually, in the course of some years, it did recover partially and as of now, there is practically no curvature at all. However, the erectile tissue is still not as it used to be, somewhat hardened and when I have an erection, the blood seems to get trapped in a way in both sides of the penis, while the glans have difficulties getting sufficient blood and arousal and often remains softer. I have no problems getting and maintaining an erection myself, but when being with a partner, it tends to be more difficult and the erection often goes away quickly if not actively stimulated. The softer glans often leads to less control and premature ejaculation.I assume I may have gotten some degree of penile fibrosis, which was triggered by the episode of prolonged erection when I was 20. My question is, would there be a (natural) way to help reduce this tissue hardening and enhance regular blood flow, particularly to the glans. Since this is not a serious issue and it seems the damage was not that substantial (I still have morning erections for example, and the feeling is often close to normal), I would be looking to some natural therapy with as little side effects as possible. I read about some allegedly very good results of combining L-arginine and pine bark extract when it comes to enhancing erection quality overall. Would you happen to know about this or could you recommend some other natural treatment options, which would not cause any other health issues? My main concern would be getting priapism due to some medicine like Viagra, as it was exactly the prolonged erection that caused my problems. If Arginine and pine bark extract are overall safe, I would be glad to opt for this.", "faq": "Is there any natural therapy to enhance blood flow to glans penis?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 43 year old female. My height is 5 feet 6 inches, and I weigh 185 lbs. I feel awful. Please tell me what you think may be wrong. Most of my adult life weight was 150 to 155 lbs. A sudden weight gain started five years ago. My weight is now always in the 175 to 185 range. I eat an extremely healthy diet. I do not eat any processed meat, almost no processed food, wheat, sugar or dairy. I eat only whole foods. I cannot control my weight unless I starve. The majority of the weight is concentrated only in the abdomen, breast, neck, and face. I have isolated fat pockets shaped like eggs above the collar bones, and my face is round and red. My upper back has an odd fat hump. My legs and arms are thin, calves too thin, butt too small, and, I look nine months pregnant.I was bulimic from the age of 23 up to 40. I still struggle with eating disorders, but I am not purging as much as I used to. Osteopenia was detected last year. I have lowered energy, generalized fatigue, and muscle weakness from the past two years. My sleep issues have gotten much worse in the past four or five years. I have trouble falling asleep, and sometimes I am awake throughout the night. I have depression, anxiety and get extremely emotional of late. I suffered a nervous breakdown, extreme sensitivity, paranoia, high anxiety, and worry. I rarely, if ever, leave the house. So, I have no friends. Sometimes, I will not even go outside for two or three weeks at a time. My cognitive difficulties have become very noticeable in the past three years or so. I often cannot find words, have trouble with spatial intelligence, have no short term memory, have difficulty with long-term memory as well. I feel lost like I am floating.I have had a high blood pressure for at least five years now, but it was never officially diagnosed. My BP still fluctuates and is not controlled with the daily 20 mg Lisinopril. My legs and feet have been swollen for the past three or four years. My hands and neck too sometimes look swollen and puffy. My feet feel hot and sweaty often. I have high cholesterol levels from five years, but it is currently untreated. My legs, arms, and hands bruise extremely easily. It takes a very long time to heal. The skin on my hands and arms are thin and shiny, The skin of my upper arms, hands, and face, have lots of broken capillaries. My hair once almost fell out completely, about 60 percent of it, all at once. Now my hair is odd, thin and dry. I also notice some increased facial hair in the past year. I have toenail fungus from the previous five years or so. I had three rounds of anti-fungal treatment, but it would not go away. I have acid reflux from the past three or four years. I always have constipation, which has gotten worse over the past five or six years. I have extreme bloating from the past five or six years. It happens anytime I eat, irrespective of what type of food it is. I first encountered kidney stones five years ago and had to undergo surgery the same year and, one again in the subsequent year. I was informed by my urologist that I have many stones. I have passed one since, but do not know how much more I have. About seven years ago, I had some inflammatory eye problem, which I was told was chalazia. I still have trouble with both the eyes. Sometimes, they are painful, and I spend the morning with a blurred watery vision. I was diagnosed with scoliosis as a teenager, for which I underwent a spine reconstruction surgery last year.  I am recovering well, but do not know yet if the bone graft was a complete success. I still experience some pain. I had a rectocele repair surgery twenty years ago. I still have some issues, but I think it is due to chronic constipation. Also, I have recurring hemorrhoid which I also believe is due to chronic constipation. I have been on some form of opioid for the past two years. And, the six months following my surgery, I was on extremely strong medicines. I took Dilaudid for about three months.I had lab tests done ten days prior, and I am concerned about few values. Cortisol - 19.5, ACTH-Mayo - 63 pg/mL , FSH - 6.4 mlU/mL, LH - 2.1 mlU/mL, Progesterone - 0.21 ng/mL, and Estradiol - 21. I have stopped all of my supplements for about two months except collagen and biotin. I did not think it would affect any of my results. Then, I read that biotin can cause false high positives. I do not think this would have impacted my results, as they are all relatively low. Also, as I noted, the cortisol and ACTH is supposed to be tested around 8 AM, but I was not tested until noon.", "faq": "Of late, I have a lot of health issues including weight gain, hair loss, and easy bruising.

I had a lot of pain for three days after he drilled and refilled the tooth, and then the pain got much better, but yesterday, day seven after he drilled and refilled, I had very intense pain, and it still hurts a lot today.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,Can I grow any longer?I am 16 years old. My parents' heights are about 5'5 and 5'0 and my sister is 5'1. I had my knee's and hand's X-ray and both of them are fused. Since then I have grown only an inch or two. I was 5'1 back then now I am like 5'3 or 5'4 in morning. I have been taking Vitamin D supplements along with Vitamin A, Zinc, and Magnesium. Doing yoga on regular basis and body weight exercises like push-ups, chin-ups, pull-ups, and dips. I have been sprinting and skipping rope and my diet is full of protein (junk food only on Sunday). I do not know how I stunted my growth. Maybe late night cravings with junk food and also bad sleeping habits might have contributed to my short stature.I have heard men do not stop growing until the age of 21 or 25. When I compare my legs to my friends we have the same length, maybe an inch or two difference but they are like 5'10 or 5'11. I have hairs on my legs from a year an a half. I have little facial hair (not too much). My genitals are not fully grown but I have pubic hairs. I want to be at least 5'7 or 5'8. Since taking HGH will not affect my legs (growth plates ossified) but will it affect my spine? I feel like my torso is very short compared to my dad too. If I can get prescription for HGH, will taking it lengthen my spine or harden the long bones which will result in growth (2-3 inches)? I have been looking for answers online but I found none relating to spine growth from HGH. As far as I have seen in gigantism most of their height comes from their torso. If I take HGH will my spine grow like theirs too? Since I am only 16 and not fully matured. I do not want to do the leg lengthening surgery (will affect my athletic performance) and also I forgot to mention I have never got a growth spurt in my life. All my height growth has been gradual. When I looked at my friends after a long summer they shot up to 4 to 5 inches. Whereas I stayed the same.

I recently had a baby and have not left the house except to go to a dental appointment one week before developing these small blisters. I went to the doctor a few hours after finding the blisters, and she ran an Ig blood test which came back negative. I also had an HSV 1 and HSV 2 test done before seven months before giving birth that came back negative. So I know I was not a carrier of the virus.After seeing what could be the beginning of primary infection, my doctor prophylactically put me on a dose of Valtrex. Three days before we did a culture swab test which came back today as negative. My question is, are there any possible ailments that would closely mirror a cold sore?I understand that if my primary infection was only two weeks ago, it is possible that it would be undetectable in the bloodstream but I was surprised that the culture swab came back negative as well. Could this be because of the use of Abreva earlier in the day? The blisters never leaked much fluid, so it was quite hard to get a great sample on the swab.After a few days, the blisters never turned into an open sore, just slowly dried and tingled a little. At this point, they appear to be gone entirely. There was never any pain associated with the sore.", "faq": "What causes blisters on the lip?"},

On a two-balloon endoscopy of the small intestine, colonoscopy with ileoscopy, CT, MRI revealed nothing. So, we can determine the location of spasm only with X-ray and barium follow through. I did barium follow through several times (with an interval of six months). There was a disagreement among the doctors and they agreed about etiology of obstruction (dynamic/spastic), but cannot decide the location of the spasm. Treatment recommended is therapeutical - endoscopic injections of Botulinum toxin into the intestine (they call it chemical denervation, and recommend it because that conservative drug therapy does not help. Therefore, it is important to know the exact location of spasm. I ask for help in this matter. I am attaching the links. The study was started 11 and half hours after swallowing barium. The last shot was taken 35 hours after swallowing barium. So, there is stasis/stagnation about 30 hours in the small intestine.The most important question is the exact location of the spastic area. It is important to know the location and length of spasm in centimeters, at least in some ranges (if absolute accuracy is not possible, but if it is possible, at least within the margin of error of a few cm, that would be perfect).

He was also suspected for swine flu, and we waited for the reports, but gradually his lungs functioning started diminishing. He showed pO2 levels of 60 in ABG at this time. But the CT scan of the lungs depicted bilateral infection. But, the doctor treating him took it reluctantly and was waiting for the swine flu report. H1N1 was negative, yet his breathing became a major problem. All this happened in two days, on the night of the second day, he was almost closing his eyes with a fever of 101 F and pO2 levels of 54 in ABG. He was shifted to ICU and was put on NIV. The next morning he did not improve, and his pO2 levels were 45.So, we shifted him to a better hospital, who again put him in an isolated ward, suspecting H1N1, but diagnosed it typical pneumonitis. All other parameters of his were normal, but he was put on a ventilator. Here also H1N1 report was negative, but the pulmonologist said that the pictures depict swine flu. The team said that he his struggling in the ventilator too, but since all other vitals are stable they promised us that he would recover slowly. On the ventilator, he showed pO2 levels of 90, but the respiratory element in the monitor showed 25 to 35. He was on the ventilator for seven days, in between they tried weaning, but he could not tolerate. On the eighth day, he was extubated and put on NIV fearing for VAP, he sustained for 24 hours in NIV with great difficulty with diminishing pO2 levels, and the respiratory element in monitor rose to 40. During this 24 hours, he was extremely drowsy, and he did not respond to us. He was restless and breathed with so much of difficulty, but then neurologist concluded that he is psychologically dull.

But the lungs are full of scars, but he does not have a fever. We do not know where to go, please help.He has not been on natural nutrition for nearly three weeks, so he is very tired. His muscles need to be mobilized, and so they thought of keeping him on the chair, but he could not. And today again he is on ventilation.

I am attaching all the reports that are available to me. Can I know if the CT reports taken two weeks back and now show any improvement? Will the endoscopy procedure help? Is there any other better treatment for the same? Will this infection of viral pneumonia decrease? The doctors tell us that he is psychologically dull and so he hesitates to fight with breathing.

I am unable to completely trace both the ureters without their disappearance and they both seem to be compressed in various regions. I can however find them again around the bladder. I understand that dilation is absent on the CT scan, however the pain only arises after hours of laying down so it would seem to make sense that dilation is not visible on the scan. Also, there seems to be an intense, vascular network posterior or underneath the kidneys that I have been unable to identify. The duodenum appears to be compressed by the SMA and the right testicular vein appears to be compressed by the duodenum. I need your help to review these issues. I feel like I am dying. I am 25 years old. This has been occurring for more than two years. I have extremely itchy skin all the time, probably due to urinary leakage or fistula or vascular issue. My identical twin brother does not have any of these issues. I do not think that I can go much longer. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help.", "faq": "Why do I get pain in the kidney region?"},

When I was 24, I took Accutane to clear up cystic acne. This was my second round of Accutane. I had also taken it when I was 16, but the acne came back. This left my skin very dry. But, this is what I regret more than anything: I started using Retinol (OTC) and exfoliating my skin with microbeads because it was dry and flaky. Because I liked the effect of Retinol, I switched to Retin-A Micro (0.1 %) while exfoliating every single day. I did this for about a year. But, I started to become concerned I was using such powerful medicine on my face. So, I stopped using Retin-A and stopped exfoliating. It has now been three months since I stopped using Retin-A or any type of exfoliant. My skin has rapidly deteriorated since, becoming gray and my pores opening up. My skin is losing any glow and becoming dull and bone-dry. My skin is so sensitive to the sun that if I expose it to any sunlight, I get awful sunspots. So, I am bone-pale and look awful.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am a 36 year old male. I am a graduate and working for a MNC company. I got married in before 10 years and it is a love cum arranged marriage. My wife is also working with me. When I was in grade 3, I got introduced to sex by a male teacher. I used to go for tuition and he used me for homosexual. Almost for a year, I was abused by him. From that time I got interest towards sex, especially oral sex. Then, that teacher got transferred to a different school. I could not control the sexual urges, so I use to masturbate from those days when I am alone. But it never stopped me from concentrating on studies. Again, I got a homosexual relation with one of my male friends in grade 8. That relation went on for around six months. Later on during my UG, I got another male friend and had a homosexual relationship for around two years. It will not be very frequent. But, like monthly once or twice. I got the habit of smoking and drinking in my PG days. When I am alone and feel the urge, I used to masturbate.I got a job and I got a chance to stay alone. I used to visit sex workers, but not frequently. I never liked to be in relation with different people. Instead, I like to stick with one girl who understand my feelings and co-operate. I got such a girl, she also a sex worker but she was not like money minded. She got some feeling towards me and gave me good moments in my life. This relation was there for around two years. At the same time, I worked hard and I got many promotions and salary increments.I met a girl in my office, who was brought up by her widow mom. She is not aware of many things, which the same age girls would know. I did not have any wrong intention towards her initially. One thing I like to mention here is that I never showed the other side of me to anyone. People still believe me, I am very good and loyal person. I got attracted towards the girl and we both started loving each other. Love was gentle and tender. She never used to come out with me. She is very scared to roam outside with a male. We got married. But, from the day one, she never used to show interest towards sex. She says sex is not the thing to enjoy and it is a sin. She also will not show any response towards sex. It is making me go crazy at times and I shouted at her. She will only cry and never change her attitude. As these continued, to control my urges I started again with masturbation, watching porn, etc., when I am alone. This was fine for these many days. Nowadays, masturbation is not giving the satisfaction to me. I am in a position like, I need a sex partner, who enjoys sex with me. I am not interested to have sex with multiple people. But, with a single person, who also enjoys sex like me. Another thing I like to mention was, we do not have a child yet. My wife got TB before marriage and her fallopian tubes were blocked. We went for years of treatment and no success. My wife did not show interest towards treatment much and we stopped it after two years. As she cannot bear a child for me and cannot sexually satisfy me, she is asking me to marry another girl. My situation is like I cannot cope up with her and proceed further in life due to unfulfilled urges and at the same time I cannot able to accept her offer and divorce her. If I leave her she will be left alone in her life. She is a good girl otherwise like she takes care of me when I fall ill, she prepares good food and when my parents use to visit us she will take care of them well. Now, every night is hell for me. It started taking me to the path of depression. I tried meditation, yoga, studying self-help books, etc. All worked for a short time only. Please help.", "faq": "My wife is not interested in sex.

A chest CT scan with contrast was conducted last week in order to follow the growth of the aneurysm that left the following impression. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the left lower lobar pulmonary artery, multiple bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Patient has no history of emboli. Multiple scans prior to surgery did not reveal such, so these seem to be the result of either the surgery or the chemotherapy itself or a combination. Patient has since been put on 1 mL injections of Lovenox, morning and night. He has infusion of FOLFOX scheduled for this week. This will be round 11 of 12 in total. Patient has two upcoming surgeries planned for this summer. The ileostomy reversal and the repair of his 5.3 cm thoracic ascending aorta. We were hoping to hear the recommendations in regards to proceeding with the infusion as a result of the most recent finding. Will further infusions slow the reabsorption of the emboli and thus delay necessary surgeries? Thank you for your help, expertise and insight.", "faq": "Can emboli form as a result of chemotherapy?"},

I have dealt with these issues for around eight years and pretty much gave up on trying to feel 'normal'. Recently, I read about how TBI can cause pituitary damage leading to growth hormone deficiency which covers several of my problems and has been underdiagnosed in patients who had TBI. I also had a severe ankle break from sliding during a paintball game a couple of years ago, five breaks in my ankle and one of the worst the surgeon had seen. I understand low bone density could also be caused by low GH and could have attributed to the severity of my break. I had also been concussed on one or two other occasions less severe than the one nine years ago. Is low GH something that I could have and should look into screening for?", "faq": "I have had multiple concussions. Is it due to growth hormone deficiency?"},
{"chq": "Hi doctor,We are trying for IVF to conceive. We have frozen our embryos and have planned for embryo transfer this month, that is on the 14th day of my wife's menstrual cycle. In the scan, everything looks normal, the endometrial thickness was 9.7 mm and had good blood flow. Today when we went for a follow-up, the doctor told us that the lining has dropped to 7.8 and conceiving would be difficult, so they have canceled the embryo transfer. She informed us that this could be due to the fibroid, which was discovered today. To confirm that, I got a scan done in two different centers, and they also confirmed that she has an intramural fibroid of 1.5 cm. What are the complications that could happen due to this? How to overcome this problem? What are the treatment options? We do not know how the thickness of the lining dropped all of a sudden. She was on Progynova tablet, and the doctor asked us to stop it for the time being. Please help us recover from this. I have attached the reports.", "faq": "What are the treatment options for an intramural fibroid?"},
{"chq": "Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia a few years ago. Over the past three years, it has gotten much worse. I take Lyrica two times a day and Tramadol as needed for the pain. I still have a great deal of pain every day. The Lyrica makes me feel like I cannot think straight and the Tramadol just does not work anymore. I was prescribed Cymbalta which I took for approximately two years. It did nothing for me either. It was after that I started taking Lyrica. I have been taking it now for about six months.I recently saw my provider and he did some trigger point injections which do help in the areas injected. He told me he does not know what else to do for me. I just feel like there are no doctors that want to even try to help people with fibromyalgia. Especially those with which all the current medications do not work. I am terribly frustrated and very tired of being in pain every day. I never get a break from the pain anymore. What other treatments are out there now. Anything new that I may have not heard of? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I work full-time and I just do not want to be so miserable while doing it.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,Since last few days, I am having left sided pain in the shoulder, upper arm, the front area near the shoulder, breast, both outer sides of the neck and collarbone area. Sometimes, it pains on the back side as well. I can feel the pain when I press the body part where the pain originates. The pain aggravates when I press. There is no accompanied shortness of breath or sweating at all. Please note that pain may not be there in all the areas at the same time. Like for now, at this point in time, I only have very mild discomfort in front area near the shoulder and breast.Some of the points to consider for diagnosis:I am hypertensive. However, my BP is very well controlled (110/80) with Metoprolol and Amlodipine. I also take Atorvastatin 10 mg for cholesterol. I am now asked to stop Atorvastatin. I am on these medications since last one year. All my below tests (one year old) are normal. EKG.Chest X-ray.Brain CT scan.Pulmonary embolism.All blood works.48 hours Holter monitor.No murmur or gallop noticed.Arterial oxygen levels.Troponin levels.All my recent blood works (two months old) like lipid profiles, kidney function test, CBP, liver function test, HbA1c, vitamin profiles (vitamin D, B12, calcium, iron), sodium, potassium, urine exam are normal. I walk daily for 20 to 30 minutes. Occasionally, I run too and do not experience any pain. Sometimes, I take stairs and do not experience any shortness of breath or pain. I had a different variant of chest pain last year. I did EKG, TMT and 2D echo and results are normal findings. It was diagnosed with non-cardiac pain. I have some mild to moderate irrational anxiety (GAD) and I am not sure if the pain I am experiencing is of psychosomatic origin. I had my left shoulder dislocated some 20 years back. In last 20 years it dislocated almost 7 to 8 times of which four times, I had to go to the hospital and get it fixed non-surgically. All other times it got fixed on its own. Last time it dislocated was I am not sure if the pain is causing because of that. I was very poor in following the instructions about wearing a sling and all. I used to be sling free immediately after shoulder is replaced back. Although I never had any problem with my left shoulder or arm, I intermittently used to get some mild pain in shoulder and upper arm. My left hand is fully functional. Although, I am careful in not rotating it 360 with a fear that it might get dislocated.Currently, I do not have acidity so I think the pain does not seem to be related to GERD. 2D echo and TMT were done just one year back and returned normal, do I need to re-do these tests? Since then I believe things should have only been improved as I made a lot of lifestyle and dietary changes. BP is very much controlled. It is always 110/80, Resting heart rate is good too. 70 to 80 BPM. Lipid profile is normal. LDL (73), HDL (46), Total (145). If it is musculoskeletal pain, could you please suggest some medicine? I am looking for something that does not disturb my BP and heart rate. Is (Tramadol + Acetaminophen) good? Please suggest some potent and safe medicine that can relieve the pain and relax the muscles. One of the DMs I contacted in person is of the opinion that it may be psychosomatic in nature and prescribed a combination of Flupentixol and Escitalopram. But I am scared of the listed possible side effects like thrombosis, QT prolongation, etc. So I did not start it yet. What is your view on this combination drug? Is it safe to give it a try for four months and then wean off over next two months?

Now, the same problem has got back after a gap of three years. But now along with problem of unbalancing I am having weakness, palpitation and uneasiness in stomach as well as having sore mouth. Four months back, I have consulted a cardiologist. He ran few tests such as ECG, echo and TMT. My heartbeat was low at 48 bpm. No problem was detected in angiogram and no blockage was present. Doctor suggested me Orcibest 10 and Tonact ASP for low pulse rate. I was referred to a neurologist. He carried out MRI of brain and spinal cord. No abnormality was detected in either of them. My vitamin B12 was found to be 507 pg/ml. Based on my history three years back; doctor gave me vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamine) shots in spite of the vitamin B12 level being normal.

She drank it almost four days, the purpose to that was she wanted to get early menstruation. It did not work so she tried next week for a ginger tea 3 times a day for 3 days. I think still did not work, tried the Parsely tea again together with the Vitamin c, both three times a day for 7 days, did not work.Until she felt back pain in her lower back and cramping on her lower abdomen too, also when she urinated there were tiny white mucus in her urine. There were days she felt a fluid is getting out of her vagina, seeing her panties it is just a white fluid, thought she will get her menstruation back but no. Still she keeps on drinking the tea and taking the Vitamins hoping for her menstruation to come, everytime she is in pain she does warm compress on her lower abdomen and back hoping to induce her menstruation. Still no menstruation. So is she pregnant? What should we do to get her menstruation back? She is so worried.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am 47 today. I went to my primary doctor three years ago with low libido and poor quality erections. Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week.Testosterone shot up to 900's but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week.The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it.So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido.Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist.So I guess in summary:Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis?If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues?Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated.

As I often work at night my sleep too gets disturbed. I am single and never had sexual contact with anyone. There is no history of skin disease, smoking and alcohol. My current issue is, I have a wart-like growth on the penis. It is located on the shaft, middle of penis, slightly towards the right side. I have this for over 20 years. It has never been carried over or has affected any other area of my body. There are no such growths anywhere in my body. I first observed it when I was 8 or 9 years old. It was neither painful nor caused discomfort. It is a flat, long hard mass appears as if inserted into pinched skin. Three years back, I had a very slight negligible discomfort after a long period of erection. When I was pinching, it came out of the sleeve of skin. It was growing in and detached from the body. It actually did not grow down into the penis, rather perpendicular. Six days ago, I had a long period of erection. Afterwards, the sensation of very slight pinching, localized pain focused on a few millimeters deep where the growth is. It is still there, but not bothering me much. But, this time it is slightly higher on the sensation scale and it is not going away.I have noticed some increase in the width. I am trying to keep it clean by frequent washing. There has never been any bleeding, redness on or around the affected area. It does not cause any problems in full erection. In fact, I feel less discomfort in full erection. Is this a wart? Is this dangerous? Would it be contagious to my sex partner? I am scared of surgery and I really prefer something non-invasive. Please suggest any topical cream or oral medication?

{"chq": "Hello doctor,First of all, let me thank you for this platform. It is just wonderful that you make professional opinion available for people who have nowhere else to turn. My mother has been showing weird behavior ever since I can remember. The issue is that anytime someone (from our family or otherwise) brings up the fact that she is acting unusual, she denies it. Everyone is wrong, and she is always right. I am wondering if maybe I describe her behavior here, I could get some opinion on whether or not she is indeed in need of help, and whether or not she can care of her children.She has a lot of mood swings, she is incredibly happy some days, and she has a small idea which she believes can turn her life around. And she would not let anyone's opinion deter her. She makes rash decisions and shops a lot, spends all the money she has. Other days, you can just see how down she is. She has difficulty getting out of bed and is extremely irritable and generally in a bad mood. She will yell and get overly angry for seemingly small reasons. Also, she lies a lot, but it is strange because it is like she does not realize she is lying. It is like she changes the facts in her head, she believes that whatever she is saying really happened, even if multiple people who witnessed the same thing say otherwise. And she will get angry if contradicted. She is also very manipulative, especially concerning her children and money. She regularly uses her kids to get money from the family and brainwashes the kids (through repetition, yelling, and psychological abuse) against any member of the family that they seem to like more than her, or that refuses to cave to her manipulation.She has no friends. Her mood swings alone are enough to drive anyone away. Also, she has a surprisingly cold attitude towards her kids. She is not warm or affectionate (I sincerely cannot remember the last time she gave any of us a hug), and she will easily put us aside if bigger interest is at stake, for example, she overlooked the fact that my step-father abused me because he gave her money. Recently, seven years after the fact, she wants to defend me, since he stopped paying up. She was prepared to do it without my consent too. She just casually mentioned it in conversation, in the same way, she would tell me about how it has been raining a lot recently. The fact that I was suffering visibly for years never seemed to bother her. Well, I think that may be enough of a description. There are a lot more details, but I believe these are the main factors that always strike me as odd. I am fine now and out of her life, but I am worried about my brothers, and whether or not they are safe with her. Please help, your opinion is greatly appreciated. I would like to have some sort of professional feedback before taking any action concerning the safety and well-being of my brothers. They mean the world to me, and if they are to be removed from the care of my mother, I need to be sure that this is indeed not normal. Because she will never admit it to herself.", "faq": "My mother has a lot of mood swings and makes rash decisions. Are my brothers safe with her?"},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old male. I do not have any medical history. Been always healthy. For the past 3 months, I have been experiencing this facial tightness which comes pretty often throughout the day with different intensity. The facial tension usually comes half an hour after I leave the bed. The tightness on my face happens to be on both sides of my face but usually more intense on the right. At times, I can feel it from my neck all the way up to my face. As of recent, I have been feeling this slight burning sensation on my chest to my shoulders as well. Prior to this facial tightness, I have been suffering from this burning feeling on the centre of my chest for about a month. It was my first time experiencing heartburn and I thought it was heart related. Went for X-rays and echo heart ultrasound. Everything came out fine. I have a healthy heart. What made the burning chest sensation go away temporarily is lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol. And the weird part is the same thing helps me relieve my facial tightness temporarily is the same thing as that for the burning chest sensation; lying down, eating, exercising and drinking alcohol.Since having this facial tightness, I have paid numerous visits to different doctors, even the neuro-specialist and they all said it was anxiety. The doctors did facial senses test where they take a piece of fine cotton to touch different parts of my face. I had to close my eyes and tell them where the spot is. I have no troubles at all. I did blood test. It came out normal. They told me I do not need to do any scans and that it was merely anxiety and it will go off by itself. I convinced myself that I had anxiety because of the one month heartburn ordeal that I was suffering from. Even though the facial tightness was there, I tried my utmost best to ignore it. I do not think that I have any anxiety in me now as I try not to think of the weird tightness sensation. However, it has been 3 whole months and now I am getting alarmed and worried that it is still here and with newer sensations as I described above. In all honesty, I do feel that the intensity of the facial tension as compared to I first experienced it, is less. However, it is always there even as when I am typing this. I do not see any physical change on my body. Not sure if it is neuro damage. I am worried sick.Hope I can get some form of advice and diagnosis.", "faq": "Am I getting facial tightnesss because of anxiety?"},

I am going through my daily routine without difficulty. The main problem is frequent urination. I faced the problem of continuous urge to urinate and mild pain on the right side for around five months ago. That time only basic blood and urine tests were conducted. As I had the pain again before a few days, I had an ultrasound.An ayurveda doctor says that I should take Stonex and Cystone tablets for two to three weeks and the kidney stone will disintegrate and pass through urine. I was advised that the creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL is not high and I need not worry. I was also advised that only in case of extreme emergency and severe pain, I should go through lithotripsy and not ureteroscopy.In contrast, the allopathy hospital says 1.2 cm stone will not come out through conservative management like Cystone and Stonex. The kidney stone is obstructing the right kidney, which has led to rise in my creatinine.I was advised to go through ureteroscopic removal of the kidney stone. Which is right?

All are normal.The pain started about two weeks ago, but was just off and on and would go away fairly quickly.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am 29 years old, mother of two healthy children, and pregnant for the third time. My LMP was 13th of last month and had only had intercourse only twice in the last three months. In the last month, I had intercourse only once before three to four weeks before having a positive pregnancy test and then a day or two after getting the positive test. I have a retroverted uterus. At an ultrasound, at 9 weeks, I was showing signs of being only 5 weeks pregnant with a gestational sac and yolk sac. At a follow-up ultrasound, one week later, the ultrasound technician thought maybe it was a molar pregnancy. There is now a fetal pole and one small ball-like shape but not any visible growth of the gestational sac. My HCG levels went from roughly from 69000 to 65500 in 48 hours. At the third ultrasound, a week after that showed the gestational sac, yolk sac, and what looked to me like two balls inside the gestational sac. My HCG levels are still going down. I was told it is a miscarriage but have had no signs other then the ultrasound saying it is a miscarriage, so I am reluctant to agree to any further action at this point. There has been no heartbeat yet, although the third ultrasound did come to a lot closer to almost finding one, but it was likely just my heartbeat, according to the technician. I need a second opinion as I am now only eight weeks and viable it would mean I miscarried the first and got pregnant immediately or I have two pregnancies going on at once. Both are very rare, or it is, in fact, a miscarriage? Also could high progesterone levels be masking the miscarriage? We have not tested yet since HCG levels are decreasing slowly already. What is stopping the contractions from happening?", "faq": "My HCG levels are decreasing gradually. Is this a sign of miscarriage?"},

Yesterday too he had to do a confirmatory blood test (Troponin) as well as ECG which confirmed he had a silent heart attack 10 days back. The admitting doctor after being informed of the test results recommended to stop Eliquis 2.5 mg 1-0-1 and take Ecosprin 150 mg 0-1-0 and tablet Plavix 75 mg 0-1-0. Also injection Clexane 80 mg SC twice a day for five days. He strongly advised getting admitted for a couple of days at least. My query is:Is hospitalization necessary now or can we wait for five days since injection Clexane 80 mg has been recommended? What is the function of the injection Clexane 80 mg recommended for five days?

When I consulted another doctor, they asked to get an x-ray of my nose and concluded that bones of the nose are not straight, so it needs an operation.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,Two days before I got my periods and I started having sudden, sharp stabbing pain in my right ovary. These pains would slowly subside, although I could always feel a small sensation in the same spot, until it flare up again. It seemed to be agitated by the movement. I stay perfectly still most of the time and so there is no stabbing feeling. I asked my mother, who is a nurse, to check it out. She validated that the pain was ovarian and cleared me of having appendicitis. Over two days the pain has continued at random times, but not worsened. Now I am on my period. The blood is thick, sticky and totally brown to pretty bright red with heavy bleeding. I am normally a heavy bleeder during the first few days, but the color and consistency are unusual. I am also having my usual period symptoms such as achiness and bloating. Hence, it is hard to pinpoint whether it is just my period or the ovarian pain. I have had normal period before this one and no sexual exposure during or in between, so I know I am not pregnant. I am also at a very low risk for STDs. I am worried, as the women on my mother's side have a history of ovarian cancer and cysts. I know I am quite young for such a thing to happen in me. As I do not have any other symptoms related to other causes such as PID, I do not know what else it could be. I just started on birth control pills again last night. Otherwise, I am not any oral medication except topical treatment for itchy scalp, acne and eczema. Am I crazy in worrying? What could this be?

A couple of hours after getting the braces, my teeth were significantly straighter (1 to 2 mm difference).A day after they look almost perfect, I was told I would be wearing the braces for six months to a year.

{"chq": "Hello doctor, I am 45 years old and working as a senior level finance professional in a multi-partner practice owned by all of us. After going through the high levels of anxiety for several years, I consulted a psychologist who is my friend. After few months of showing little improvement, he put me on Escitalopram 10 mg. For about 2 years I took this medicine and was generally fine. When my friend moved out of the country, I shifted to a new doctor and he is a more senior person. He changed the drug to Paroxetine 25 mg which I have been on for the last nine months. I would probably say I am doing better now than before. The issue is regarding further counseling. While my friend did not feel that there is a need to continue counseling once he put me on the medicine. But, the new one seems to feel that I should resume counseling. Based on his advise, I went back to the counselor I originally saw, but somehow she seems to feel that I do not need any structured counseling.I am generally a religious person and try to follow certain regular spiritual practices like visiting a temple almost every day, reading at least a little from any scripture and do some chanting. At the same time, I still have the little odd feelings of discomfort too at times, though it does not trouble me so much like earlier. Specific cause of worry now is mostly the side effect of the long-term medication I take for anxiety, BP (Telmesartan) and for GERD (Esomeprazole). The primary concern now is that on most days I have a general feeling of boredom as though there is not anything much to do. Generally, I try to avoid associating with any new demanding assignments because I do not feel comfortable about doing things unless I am fully sure about the work. On the other side, it is also my dream to be a successful writer of fiction novels. I have finished one book, but that has not found any worthy publisher so far, which is disappointing. So, even though I have been working on my second book, I do not have too much confidence that my writing will reach anywhere.I am not a social type person and like to spend time at home. I will also confess that by nature I am known as a negative thinker, both at work and in the house. But my relationship with people are generally very cordial, because I try to lighten issues and also try my best to avoid any sort of conflict. All this leaves me with a general sense of dissatisfaction, although I am very clear that I do not want to stick my neck any further out either. Though at times, I fantasize about career and location change. I do not dare to think anything seriously, because I am sure that I will not get such a comfortable position again. But, to conclude the issue which is confusing me right now is, do I need counseling again? I am far from clear, what can I hope to achieve from therapy which I cannot get from my religious and spiritual practices? I note that online therapy is also an option on this site. Is that as effective as direct counseling?", "faq": "I am doing better with my anti-anxiety drug. Do I need counseling?"},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I have gotten two different opinions from two pediatricians about my 8 months old boy. One says my boy has Hirschsprung's disease, and the other says it is just constipation. The first doctor did a rectal exam, yielding no explosive stools, and he wants my son to get a barium enema. The second doctor did not do a rectal exam and just felt my boy's stomach, and said it is not hard and has good bowel sounds. She told me to up his apple juice or water to 8 oz per day with probiotics. KUB was done and shows lots of stool in the large intestine, so the doctor told me to give Miralax and liquid suppository.My son did have suppository a week before the visits with hard poop smear in each diaper ever since. During that time, I had been reporting to my first doctor about my son's constipation. My son started with gentle solids at six months. He is today exactly 8 months old, weighs 21 lbs, and has over 90 % growth in the growth chart. He does not have weight issues. He never had a fever, no blood in stools, has passed his meconium, and had a few projectile vomiting in his lifetime.My son does not fit the HD diagnosis, but my doctor says because of the rectal exam yielding no explosive stool it means it is stuck in the large GI. Is there harm in performing barium enema? My son already had an x-ray, which shows lots of stool in the large intestine. I also just gave him Pedia-Lax, and he had a good bowel movement for the first time since two weeks. I am attaching a picture. I will give him Miralax this weekend with 8 oz liquid a day with probiotics and no solids for now. Is barium enema an old school method?I am so torn because the first doctor in a specialist and has 50 years of experience, and he is adamant that my son has HD even after consulting with his colleagues. Could this just be a bad case of constipation? Maybe, I did not insert the first suppository correctly, and maybe my son did not get enough liquid this whole time, this second liquid suppository really helped. The second doctor has eight years experience, and she is so conservative. She does not want to give a rectal exam or even suppository. She says my son is at a low risk and does not have HD. Should I see a gastroenterologist or my son before we proceed with the barium enema or should we just get it done at this point and see the results?

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I have been worried about my heart lately, and I was hoping you could answer a question I have regarding diastolic blood pressure. I recently did a test at home measuring my blood pressure before and after exercise using an Omron M3 comfort blood pressure monitor. In each case, I did for two minutes of step-ups, walking up and down two steps for that period of time. My blood pressure before exercising was 114/84 mmHg, and my heart rate was 71. Afterwards, I was sweating lightly and my heart was pounding. My blood pressure was 153/94 mmHg and my heart rate was 88. Two minutes after resting, my blood pressure was 145/108 mmHg, and my heart rate was 88. Two minutes after that, my blood pressure was 136/85 mmHg and my heart rate was 81. I am worried about the rise in my diastolic blood pressure immediately after exercise, and especially the fact that it seemed to continue to rise before dropping back. I should also say that I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and as a result, I recently had two resting electrocardiography, blood work, a cholesterol test, and a blood sugar test, all of which have come back normal.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am an 18 year old girl. My height is 5'7 (171 cm), and weight is 135 pounds. Around five months back, I started becoming extremely fatigued and had occasional headaches. As headache was not often and not bad enough, I never really thought much about it. The fatigue was the worst part. It would cause me to become extremely tired throughout the day, and I would be ready to fall asleep at 7 PM every night. Waves of fatigue would come and go. I went to the doctor about this on two occasions for blood tests, and nothing came out of the ordinary. Two months later, I developed a pressure headache in the front of my head one night. It did not feel like a migraine. It was just a terrible pressure mostly centered in my forehead. The feeling was a tightness or like something was pushing on my head. It was frustrating and aggravating. The pressure did not go away for two weeks. It was almost constant, and sometimes the pressure would lessen, but never entirely go away. It would get to the point where I would cry every night because it felt like my head was going to burst open.I went to a neurologist who recommended getting my ferritin levels tested. I had a level of 7, and I was prescribed with Ferrous sulfate and Vitamin C supplement. Over the next six weeks, the fatigue disappeared almost entirely. The headaches seemed to be improving, not constant and not as bad. Again, by last month, the pressure in my forehead began to return. Over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more constant and with higher intensity. I can feel the pressure even when I write this. After a couple of weeks (now), the pressure became just like it was before the ferritin treatment. It is not present all the time, but the majority of the time. I first notice the pressure anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour after I wake up. The pressure is often around for so long that it makes me frustrated and moody. My parents think that my headaches have to do with the hormones. In fact, the reason I am so upset is because the headaches have been plaguing me. If the pressure disappeared, I would not be so upset. I am now starting to think that the fatigue and headaches were not related and that the Ferrous sulfate only fixed my fatigue.I went back to the neurologist, and she was very unhelpful. She only spoke to me for less than 10 minutes and asked me what we should do next. She believes that my problem can be fixed with different kinds of medicine and is not looking anywhere else. As of two weeks ago, my ferritin is at a 22, and I am continuing to take it. I tried Topamax for a couple of days before two months, but I stopped because the side effects made me feel five times worse. Two weeks ago, I tried Amitriptyline but stopped that because of the strange side effects. As of four days ago, I have been taking Propranolol, but nothing has changed. The neurologist seems to believe that I have anxiety and this is what is causing my headaches. I have my head screwed on tight as my dad says, and I truly do not have any depression or anxiety. I am not abnormally stressed, and I do well in school. I go back to the neurologist after a month, but I do not think I want to continue seeing her. I am looking for answers. I do not know what else to do. My parents are underestimating me and chalking it up to hormones. These pressure headaches have been plaguing me ever since three months, and it is starting to affect my social life and attitude. I cannot live like this anymore, and I just need help. Any of your advice is appreciated. Thank you.", "faq": "What are the possible reasons for my terrible headache?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 32 year old male, who weighs 115 lbs and I am 5.10 feet tall. I woke up after an hour of sleep with shortness of breath and numbness in my right arm. I have been suffering from a cold, for a week now. Five days ago I boarded a flight, I got congested during the first leg of the flight, and got no sleep. On the second leg after dozing off briefly, I woke up feeling numb in my arms, particularly the right arm, and shortness of breath that quickly spiraled into extreme shortness of breath, a racing heart, and hot flushes. The airline crew placed me on oxygen for the remaining two hours of the flight. My blood pressure was on the higher side and pulse came back fine as well. When I landed, the airport clinic gave me Amoxicillin and checked my vitals, and they were stable, so they released me.After two nights of difficult or no sleep, I went to a hospital, where my blood pressure was138/93 mmHg. So, the doctor prescribed me a Pseudoephedrine and Paracetamol, to take along with the Amoxicillin. I have been taking them every 8 hours as prescribed, and they appear to be helping. They performed an EKG and found nothing wrong.This brings me to the current problem. I am still experiencing difficulty in sleeping even with the medication. I managed to doze off for an hour first thing last night but woke up with shortness of breath and my right arm numb. I was sleeping on my back and did not roll on the arm. I recovered and tried for several hours to fall back to sleep. Why is only my arm going numb? Is it deprived of oxygen due to the cold? If so, why not other limbs too?

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I started having right sided pain in the rib area around one year and three months ago. It got really bad last week and I went to a doctor. They did an ultrasound and found several hyperechoic nodular foci on the liver. He said this could simply represent hemangiomas but could be mucinous metastases. I started panicking as I have always had bad health anxiety. I went to get a CT scan and could not do a contrast so found well defined mildly hypodense mass measuring 44.6x32.9 mm. I started to get really bad - not sleeping, not eating, losing weight, bad headaches, ringing in ears, muscle twitches, shaking, etc. They scheduled me for biopsy and when I got there the surgeon said they pulled up my old CT from six years ago and the mass had not changed. So, it was most likely hemangioma and not going to do a biopsy.I still kept on the downward spiral as I did not believe them. I was told an MRI with contrast was the best test for liver lesions so I paid and had that done. Also had a brain MRI done because I thought I definitely had stage 4 cancer. All of this was one year back. MRI showed multiple liver lesions with largest 30.5x23.9 mm. T2 hyperintense and several others. All identified as behaving as hemangiomas and simple cysts. Not being satisfied with that I had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy done. Both alright. Decided to go to liver specialist and they did another MRI with 9 cc Multihance. Findings were all clear except liver with multiple lobulated T2 hyperintense hepatic lesions largest being 3.1x2.5 mm. All consitent with hemangiomas. No suspicious hepatic lesions.The specialist also told me if I had stage 4 I would be in very bad shape with no treatment. I started back working out and put all my weight back on up to 200 lbs and feeling better except same pain in right side rib area every day. Got another six month follow up MRI last month and nothing had changed. Last week, I started having pain again in right rib area and started internet searching again and finding most hemangiomas are single not multiple and most metastases are multiple, which mine are. Also that hemangiomas are mostly in women not men. So now I am back to not sleeping, not eating, and feeling like I have some type of stage 4 cancer. Never had any cancer diagnosis though and none in my family. Eat good, worked out twice a day, only drink water, maintain a healthy weight.Even though I know in almost a year and a half with no treatment and stage 4 I would be bad shape or actually dead as the average lifespan of stage 4 metastases without treatment is 8.7 years, but I do not really believe that because they are not oncologists. I looked up and saw that NET's could be slow-growing cancers and maybe I have that. I just need an independent second opinion on what could cause right side pain besides what is showing up in all the tests I have had done. Also if having three MRI's with contrast saying the same thing is specific enough to rule out liver metastases. Online it shows MRI with contrast has a 97 % specificity when done one time so is three times even better to rule it out? Why would a male in great shape otherwise develop hemangiomas throughout the liver? Would a PET scan be better than MRI at this point?

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I have been taking Furosemide (Lasix) for swollen legs prescribed by PCP 20 milligrams daily as needed since last year. This was during a followup following a hospitalization for swollen legs due to feet infection. The hospital doctor said that the swelling would go down in time, but was not so. I saw the PCP. The medication has only helped a little. There was some improvement, but legs and feet are still swollen. A week ago, I started having problems that when I urinate and go to wipe, I cannot get dry. I have to keep on wiping going through 12 rolls of tissue and still am not dry. It stops on its own after I put depends on an hour or more later. It looks like urine on the tissue. So, I am assuming it is urine. I do not know what else it could be. It is taking me an hour or longer to wipe.The PCP took a urine sample to test for UTI. He does not know what the problem is. He has not come across this problem ever before. He does not think the Lasix is causing this. I stopped the Lasix five days ago before seeing the PCP. But, the problem has continued. This is very distressing and interferes with getting my daily activities done. I was diagnosed with overactive bladder by a urologist four years ago. Due to a problem with colonic inertia, the doctor would only prescribe one medication Myrbetriq which did not work and the doctor had me stop it because it only raised my blood pressure.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 35 year old male, who is in good health. So, here is the story. It first started two weeks ago. My girlfriend thought it would be fun to remove my pubic hair one night. She started the waxing process, but after the first removal strips had been off, I decided I was never going to do that again. It was very painful. I agreed that using a razor to shave everything would be fine for now. I had never shaved my pubic region, and later it became a bit irritated and sensitive, but nothing I could not survive. About a day later, I started running a high fever (around 102.5 F) for a day or two, then ended up going to the ER after I found that my lower leg was red and swollen as well. They diagnosed me with cellulitis. As soon as they started running IV antibiotics, my fever broke, and things looked good. They sent me home with Doxycycline, and I was good.I am only mentioning the cellulitis as there was no evidence of cuts or scrapes, so we do not know here the infection came from, but now I think it could be from the waxing or shaving torture that I had been though. My penis had been sore after the shaving, and I recently have been masturbating dry (no lubricant) quite a lot, four times a day was common. My penis was a darker color from the excessive masturbation and sex. Even though it was uncomfortable, I still did it.So a few days ago after having 3 or 4 sex sessions and previous masturbation before that, I noticed a couple of small bumps on my middle shaft that morning. There is no pain, no itching, and no redness. I have never had anything like this before, and I am very observant with my body. They have been there for 2 to 3 days, and have not changed at all. I stopped sex and masturbation after noticing them. I have no other symptoms. I was worried about herpes, but they do not seem to match any of the pictures I see online. I do not have redness, tingling, pain, or itching. They are at the same spot where I was feeling the friction burns earlier.My girlfriend just so happen to have a full Pap smear a week ago, and they did STD testing, and everything was normal. My last partner was over six months, and we had protected sex. I always ask about sexual health and everything to try to be safe. I understand that the majority of herpes happens within a week of exposure and that the first outbreak is the worst, but they can hide dormant for long periods. It feels like this is a dumb choice to shave and irritate my pubic region and also do excessive masturbation and sex while ignoring the friction pain, and I possibly ended up with a friction blister type of situation. If I start getting other side effects, I will stop by my doctor. I just wanted a professional to chime in.", "faq": "I developed small bumps on my penis after excessive masturbation and sex.

The pain went away out of the blue; I sat up on my bed from lying down and was feeling that I can go running now, just like nothing happened to me. Still, doctors suggested an ICU and I got admitted. They did all tests in the next two days and discharged me with a suggestion of an angiogram. I got angiogram within a week and the report came normal. Now, my problem is, sometimes I feel very little chest pain, which is usually sharp. But, it is sometimes vague in various areas of my upper body. I do not know what my problem is. Can you please check my reports? That incident occurred one year back and I just recently did some usual basic tests. Please tell me your suggestion. Thank you.", "faq": "Is my angiography report normal?"},

All my tests including ECG, TMT, 2D echo, brain CT scan, pulmonary embolism (to rule out the cause for sinus tachycardia), 48 hours Holter monitor, chest X-ray, lipid profile, and kidney and liver function tests. TMT, 2D echo, CBP, and vitamins are normal. I was prescribed Metoprolol tartrate 50 mg twice a day, Hydralazine hydrochloride 25 mg twice a day and Amlodipine 5 mg twice a day. As I had slightly high total cholesterol I was also prescribed Atorvastatin 10 mg. Doctors suggested two changes to the above medicine regime as follows:Stop Hydralazine hydrochloride.Take Metoprolol succinate (extended release) instead of Metoprolol tartrate (immediate release).So, currently I am on Metoprolol succinate XL 50 twice a day, Amlodipine 5 mg twice a day and Atorvastatin 10 mg once a day. My BP is very much controlled (110/80 mmHg), and heart rate average is 70 to 80 beats per minute. At night time it drops to 60 to 70 range. My cholesterol is very much under control, the total is 140, LDL is 73, HDL is 43.

Can I switch back to Metoprolol tartrate (immediate release) or is there any other beta blocker which is as effective and safe as Metoprolol and does not cause hair thinning?Metoprolol is also causing my HbA1c to go higher. It is now 5.4.Within one month of taking Atorvastatin, my cholesterol level has come down. I have been taking Atorvastatin for last one year. Can I stop it now? I do regular exercise. I walk 20 to 30 minutes on all days.", "faq": "Do beta blockers cause hair thinning?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 52 year old male, very fit. I have rounded shoulders with slight thoracic kyphosis and sit at the desk often but do shoulder, neck, back stretching exercises regularly to combat this. I think that the main problem is coming from weakness in my thoracic spine, causing me to use arms to support myself on the desk. I think the weakness may be coming from my T11/T12 area as it shows up as having a fairly damaged disc compared to others (see attached MRI).Although the whole T3-T10 area seems to have dessicated discs that I have had since my 20s. I have had fairly tight hamstrings all my life and I have tried to stretch them intensely with a number of standard stretches, which works for a short while but they quickly become tight again. I have noticed just recently that using the leg press machine at the gym (see photo attached) is helping a lot to stretch my hamstrings.What I am confused about however is that when I keep the legs loaded, I eventually feel a great stretch and workout on my lower back and then in the T11/T12 area I mentioned, directly around the joint. This seems to be the only way I seem to get to feel a release in the thoracic joints and what feels like strengthening, but it has never been recommended to me. I have done thoracic spine strengthening in isolation (using floor back extensions, as well as tennis balls etc) and as I said hamstring stretching in isolation, but they have limited effect.I am hoping this exercise will do the trick in terms of restoring some flexibility and strength to my thoracic area and take some load off my upper spine and neck from the poor desk posture. I would appreciate any thoughts that you have.", "faq": "What would be a good workout routine for me based on my health limitations?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I have multiple questions. Recently, I might have been exposed to mercury vapor in a hotel room I was sleeping in for around 6-10 hours the room was small and the type of mercury was unknown. I remember the one type of chemichal was clear liquid watery substance and the other onces was more clay grey wich dissolved in water. I left the room around 6-10 hours later and did not touch anything but I might have breathed in the vapors in this small room. I also washed away the crystals that has landed on the carpet. All of these substances I have no clue about what was, except when I asked I was told mercury. 3.5 months later I got a pins and needles feeling in arms and feet wich has lasted a month, but no other symptoms until now I feel like I have some kind of internal vibration in my feet and my knees are shaking when I stand up like I am freezing or have done a hard workout from time to time. I went to the doctor in my area and told him about what had happend and showed him pictures of the various substances and I took a urine test and a blood test and this was made around 130 days after possible initial exsposure and the test came back at normal levels, but can it be that I had a toxic exsposure and the mercury has already settled in organs and therefore do not show in blood or urine I am not sure about the half life times in these metals or can I settle down and accept the test results are final and that mercury levels do indeed declear that I have not had an exsposure of toxic levels and that my symptoms might be of other cause?2. If not number one is the cause then, a few months before that, I got an acute pins and needles feeling in hands and feet (paresthesia) which continued untill today and it increased over the one month before it stabilized a little, it went from pins and burning sensations different parts of the hands, and pins feeling in the legs. A few times I got shooting pain from a finger and up my arm but very rarely which has not returned. After alcohol consumption one weekend it went from stabilized to worse and I also noticed my knees shakes a little when I stand still but not when I am walking, the feeling can be compared to when you are freezing or after a hard workout on your feet. It started with a sensation under my feet like I was standing on a vibrating phone and then moved up to my calves which felt like they were bubbling inside and now my knees which shake when I stand, but the vibration under the feet is gone. My hands also one week felt like they was shocked and they turned red and stiff, the kind of feel like I put my hands down in hot water and then removed them, red spots on my hands underneath the skin appeared and the closest thing i found resembeling it was purpura when I looked up causes online, my hands are much better now but it still feels like some areas are sunburnt and my fingertips are peeling, but I think that is because of winter and dry weather (the red spots remains) I have taken multiple blood test for vitamins deficency and other things which turned out normal besides vitamin D which was a little to low and neurolgical test like standing on one foot with eyes closed and finger pointing and sensation test of sharp/cold/hot which all was normal.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 38 year old man, 280 lbs. I have a 4 mm kidney stone that I went to the ER for on 12th last month because of the pain. The CT scan said A 3 x 4 mm calculus is present in the proximal left ureter at the level of L3. There is mild dilation of the proximal left ureter and renal pelvis, but no hydronephrosis. Left proximal ureteral calculus measuring 3 x 4 mm. There is mild associated dilation of the proximal left ureter and renal pelvis. On 25th, I was back in the ER with bad pain and had another CT scan. The scan said The lung basis are clear. There is no fluid in the pleural space on either side. No pneumothorax is seen. A 4 mm stone is again seen in the proximal left ureter in unchanged position causing mild dilatation of the ureter and the renal collecting system. Again, there is only minimal stranding in the fat surrounding the proximal ureter. No interval change. Partially obstructing stone in the left proximal ureter. Fatty infiltration of the liver and borderline sized spleen.I went back to the ER on 26th due to pain and they recommended against another CT scan due to radiation. I got Morphine and survived but I do not know if the stone moved. Now, on 10th this month, I went back to the ER because of pain and did not do a CT scan so I do not know where this stone is. I do not know what to do. I think it may be in my bladder waiting for me to pee it out, but what if it is stuck in the exact same spot from 30 days ago? Should I go ahead and do another CT scan? I am in no pain now. Each time I went to the ER, I was blood and urine tested and my kidney function is fine and there are no infections. I am just worried this stone is sitting there.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,Five days ago, I had a drug interaction. I was cleaning my wood pellet stove, running up and down the stairs to get tools from my workshop and during the process, I noticed I was sweating and my heart was racing. I sat down in front of my clock and checked my heart rate, it was 162 BPM. I had a doctor's appointment that day anyway, so I took a shower and got dressed to go to my orthopedic. I felt a little off while I was in the office and spent like I ran a marathon. When the nurse put the finger heart rate monitor on I noticed my heart was still running between 115 and 120. My BP was 140/110 also high. I think something I put into my body yesterday interacted with my prescription meds.I said something to the nurse when I saw my heart rate, she said to speak to the doctor about it.I started using Minoxidil 5 % a week ago to help thicken one side of my beard and assumed that maybe it was interacting with my meds because it was only my second day taking it. I checked for drug interactions and did not see any between it and my meds when I started using it. The doctor told me that Minoxidil should not cause this condition. The Minoxidil box says Minoxidil can cause your heart to race. I checked Minoxidil interactions and found several people who claim they had interactions immediately after using it.I went home, alerted my psychiatric nurse and then took to the internet to try to find some answers.My heart rate and BP came back down last evening. I found several things that could have caused a problem and was hoping someone might be able to shed some light on the issue. I take three prescription drugs daily:10 mg Ritalin three times daily for ADHD (just started taking eight months ago).100 mg Zoloft once daily for PTSD.100 mg Seroquel once daily for insomnia.I went untreated for years and began to suffer extreme anxiety and depression. So, I saw a doctor over a year ago. Ultimately, I was diagnosed as ADHD and PTSD. I have had sleeping problems since I hit puberty, it is genetic on my mother's side of the family so I addressed that too.I also have SIBO, small intestine bacteria over-production. I am on a low FODMAP diet, and mostly use aloe vera gel and occasionally use calcium pills to control heartburn. When I started taking these meds I was 20 pounds lighter.My resting blood pressure was 107/70 and my resting heart rate was about 55 to 60.I started smoking again last year, then I injured my right forearm so I stopped working out on top of it all. My blood pressure has steadily climbed. At my last visit to my psychiatric nurse this week my BP was 128/80 and my heart rate was 60 BPM. I asked my nurse if she thought the Ritalin was causing my BP to rise, she said it is the smoking and lack of exercise. I quit smoking tobacco a month ago, and switched to an e-cig, I am down to 3 mg of nicotine, next step is 0. So I am dealing with that. As soon as my arm is 100 %, I will return to the gym too.For the holidays, my wife made a beautiful spread of food I should not have eaten, but I did anyway. On top of that, I did some drinking, vodka, club soda and OJ over the weekend and my heartburn was out of control. It is just starting to subside right now so I have been taking more calcium pills to help control the heartburn. I found an article that said Calcium pills can raise the pH level in your stomach which can cause Ritalin to absorb more into your bloodstream.I found another article that said Minoxidil can cause a racing heart rate because of a sudden decrease in blood pressure. The article said that your heart will race to bring your blood pressure back up, but no data to confirm that hypothesis.I have also got a cold, I have been taking a generic Sudafed 12 hour for a week or so too. I found that the Sudafed I was taking can interact with Ritalin, but again no data to confirm. By the way, it is real Sudafed, not the PE. And for the record, I took some Sudafed this spring and did not notice any problems, but I was 20 lbs lighter and in better shape.There is also a laundry list of problems and drug interactions associated with Seroquel. Did I mix a dangerous concoction of Ritalin, Sudafed, and Calcium pills? I did not take Ritalin, Minoxidil or Sudafed today. I am gonna just deal with the cold and would love someone to weigh in on what could have caused this issue.That is all I have got. Thanks in advance.", "faq": "Is my heart racing due to a drug interaction?"},

A decay was present at the roots, and I was referred to an endodontist and a root canal treatment was the suggestion.The dentist did a temporary filling, which fell out soon after. The tooth appeared settled, and I had delayed taking an appointment with the endodontist. Two months ago, I started to feel sensations of extreme nerve pain, when a pressure was put on the tooth, and it was getting worse after a few days. But, it settled again.Finally, I took an appointment with the endodontist. He took an image of the tooth and said that it could not be saved, and extraction was the only option. The tooth was alright except for the occasional jolt of pain.Last week, I was awakened many times at night with a dull toothache. It progressed to the next day. I took Neuropin and Panadol for pain relief. The pain then changed to a throb and was increasing. I had a packet of Keflex with the worry of an abscess. Four days ago, I had sudden numbness from under my left lip over my chin. I rang my endodontist on the next morning, and he organized to have the tooth removed the same afternoon.On the day after the extraction, the numbness was still there.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I have an anal fissure, internal hemorrhoid, SRUS, and constipation. One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured?

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I have a question regarding my daughter. She is 6 years old. Her symptoms are tummy ache around the abdomen area. The navel looks slightly swollen only during pain and she feels full after a few bites. The pain usually occurs in the morning upon waking up.
