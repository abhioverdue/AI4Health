It is almost as if my brain is no longer autonomously processing information around me, creating memories, stimulating me with thoughts and ideas. I feel empty and blank. The severity of this feeling fluctuates and it seems to improve sometimes, especially if I am not feeling overly anxious or if I do positive things like working out or meditating. I do not know how much of this I can attribute to pure psychology and I am worried more and more that there is something physically wrong with my brain. It almost feels dementia like. My short-term or the working memory can be extremely short-lived and sometimes when thinking through pretty basic thoughts or narratives or plotlines or solving simple problems, I easily forget what I was thinking about or I cannot hold the pieces of information long enough in my head to make sense of them.Most of the time, it is not that I do not understand the problem it is just that I am trying to wrap my head around. Rather, I will be able to fully explain it to myself and come to the answer, but still for some reason be unclear as to whether I truly got it or not, and so then I will force myself to go through the logic of the problem again and again until I am satisfied with how much it has been solidified in my head. I might not have articulated this too well, but I am only saying it to underscore that this seems to be more a problem of information processing rather than my analytical abilities. I have found that my long-term memory seems to be somewhat stronger. This is especially true for memories formed a long time ago, which leads me to believe that maybe my recent short-term memory problems are also preventing me from encoding enough information in the moment to create vivid memories. Anyways, whatever this is, it has been further exacerbated by my intense focus on the problem, which is preventing me from being happy and sending me back into depression. I am seeing a neurologist in two months but I really do not want to wait that long to talk to someone. Meanwhile, I would love some insight or opinions on what this might be. Sorry if this explanation was somewhat rambly and disjointed. I am not very good at putting this problem into words so let me know if there is anything I should clarify or elaborate on further. Of note, I am on Advair and Albuterol and in the past, I have been on Wellbutrin.The onset of these symptoms seems to have maybe been gradual but my acknowledgment of how bad they are was definitely more abrupt and coincided with my efforts in trying to climb back into the real world after my depressive episode. Another strange symptom that has presented itself for a while is ED and I have been concerned that the presentation of ED with neurological symptoms could suggest MS. Are my worries valid? Kindly reply.", "faq": "I feel my senses are dulled and I am unmotivated. What should I do?"},

I have had it tested by two opticians. One of them said that I should get checked for MS, which my doctors and neurologist scoffed at, and the other said he could not see any symptoms of a tumor. The only thing that seems to take the edge off the pain is strong co-codamol 30/500.I have also noticed recently that sometimes I do lose grip in my dominant hand, and sometimes struggle to put sentences in the right order, or just lose my balance.

After that, I started to lose weight at a rapid rate, 40 lbs in 15 months. I was given multiple blood tests, an upper endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasounds. The only thing of significance was minor gastritis and some gallbladder sludge, nothing else. I have no hepatitis or autoimmune issues. I do not have Wilson's disease. 11 months ago, I had a blood test showing elevated ALT liver enzymes and slight liver enlargement. Total bilirubin was elevated as well. I had more ultrasounds, a liver biopsy, a colonoscopy, abdominal CT scan and MRI. Nothing was out of the ordinary with the imaging, except more sludge and possibly small stones. The biopsy showed 'minimal portal and lobular inflammation' with an indication of a resolving process. My liver enzymes continue to be elevated, my stool is constantly yellow and now for the last six months, it floats. At this point, the doctors continue to investigate, but cannot figure out what is happening.I do not drink, use drugs or anything of the sort. I am seeking advice as to what the doctors might not be seeing. I do not seem to have any type of GI or surrounding structure cancers. What else could cause ALT liver enzymes to elevate?

My doctor arrived at the 4 mg per day amount gradually and it works very well along with CBT from a therapist. Before two months, when I received the medication from the pharmacy it was for 3 mg /day. I asked them to double check and that was the quantity that my doctor had written. I call his office and the office manager said that she would ask him about it. When I called the next day she said that he did not make a mistake and I asked for an explanation and was told that he did not give one.I started to feel sick a few days later and panic attacks actually started to increase the day that I talk to his office manager.

Also, these are happening without any intention. I would like to know whether this abnormal behaviour is inborn from childhood. There is lot of issue in our sexual relationship as he could not fulfil his desire as he takes out his anger in another manner. Because of this, I took him to a urologist and he suggested Tazzle 10 mg and Nano leo. After using the medicines, I got conceived and now I am 5 months pregnant. He stopped using Tazzle and Nano leo for a month and ordered L-Arginine without doctor consultation. He seems to be normal, but his behavior differs sometimes. In fact he has mental pressure from his family members as he is taking care of them financially. I am desperately looking for a solution. I am afraid about my married life. I will be happy if my husband becomes normal. Please help.", "faq": "Please help me cure my husband's behavior issues."},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now.

Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose. The amount of rest I have taken and all those manipulations have gone through have only done badly rather than doing any good. I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,For almost a week now I have had recurring random pain just behind both of my ear lobes. It has been almost three weeks since I stopped Lyrica, Pregabalin completely for back pain. For the last week I have been experiencing something different which can be best described as random pressure or light pain almost behind both the ear lobes, sometimes the feeling is localized just there other times it travels towards the neck, occasionally towards the mastoid bone or it extends towards the lower jawline. I have been crazily searching to see if this is a result of any swollen lymph node fearing cancer but I could not find anything out of the ordinary on the body. Very rarely I feel this pressure going upwards to the ear and even more rarely a sudden pain arises inside the ear too but I hear no ringing or sounds. The weirdest thing is today I woke up with this sensation and I could feel heaviness behind my ears.This has come after an acute sinus infection, cough, night sweats (for which I had to take antibiotics) that hit me when I started tapering off Lyrica last month. I have had chronic sinus issues in the past too but this one was different, never had it progress to this level. I have uploaded an image of where exactly the pain or pressure originates but right now the pain or pressure is pretty spread out randomly across the neck. Can you please tell me what is going on and what could be the cause of this pain or pressure? Medicines: Although the sinus problem seems to be resolved now I am still taking Loratadine D, Xynosine nasal spray and Librax for IBS related issues.", "faq": "Why is there recurrent pain behind ear lobes?"},

We use floor cleaner liquid, so these chemicals might also be present on the floor. We would want her to try her movements freely but also would like to be cautious on possible infections. In such a case, is it better to use a mat or is it fine to leave her on the floor even if it is dusty and cleaned with chemicals?In the event of things given to her to play with, I wanted to give only silicon teether or BPA-free toys and avoid plastic toys, but plastic toys are more appealing to her. She often keeps them in her mouth. Should we sterilize the teether or toys every time we give it to her? A doctor advised against pacifier, as we cannot keep cleaning it every time the baby uses it. Which is better? Shall I let her keep fingers in the mouth instead or to pacify her with teether or toys? Also, will toys improve her skills? For example, toys manufacturer claims rattling toys would improve her ears, etc.During her birth, we were advised to keep her in the sun early mornings from 6 to 8 AM or evening from around 5 to 6 PM.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am a 28 year old male. I am married. I am under stress and depression. I got married under a forceful pressure from my mother, despite me telling her to postpone it for few years. As I was very obedient to her, I succumbed to her demand for marriage. After six months of my marriage, my wife was brainwashed by her mother to come back to her house and live with them. Only by that she can live a luxurious free life. I heard all these when she was talking over the phone. My wife agreed with her mother for all the plans to take me out of my home and go to her mother’s house. I thought, let me not talk openly about this and change her attitude patiently instead of being aggressive. Unfortunately, my wife’s brothers are living in their in-laws home. There are living an immoral life and now my wife wants the same trend. On the top of it, my mother’s behavior also changed and every time there is some fight between my mother and my wife. In the meantime. I know my wife like to have marital affairs. The dispute got worse where my in-laws keep telling my neighbors that I am torturing husband and all cheap accusations. They came to my house along with neighbors and I clearly got to know they want their daughter to come back and take care of them instead of my parents. My mother-in-law is not happy with her husband. At this age, she has extramarital affairs. All the unknown people come to her house in her husband’s absence. I got to know all these notorious after my marriage. People do say that she was a sex worker before her marriage, which is sadly true. She openly teaches my wife about pornography, watching all boys (that she regularly does) and all the shameless stuffs. I am good looking, appear very young, very smart and look very professional in my dress, outlook. Most of my neighbors are jealous of looking at me as well in professional look.When all these false accusations were made against me, I was silent and kept quiet but now I feel depressed and alone. I regret why I did not reply to them. I blame god, fate, my mother and everyone for all these. I feel like hearing those words of accusation in my ears. I regret why I could not reply to them. I regret why this type of notorious women came to life. I regret why I marry. I murmur to me as if I am replying to them of their accusations. I get angry frequently now and my mood changes frequently. One time I will blame with frustration to god and after sometime I feel let them learn a lesson.I consulted a psychiatrist and he recommended Estomine SF once daily for three months. I took it for three months and I was fine. There were no negative thoughts and I started with normal life. I was happy with recovery. Now, I have stopped the medications. Already one month over. Again, same negative thoughts coming to my mind as usual. No control on my thoughts of blaming to all. I do not know what to do? My doctor said to change the lifestyle. He advised me to do meditation, as the tablets cannot help in the long run. I have lots to study for my IT exams in four months. I am unable to concentrate. Please advise. What is my condition? Why am I getting these negative thoughts over and over? Should I start taking tablets? Should I change the tablet? I like fitness and bodybuilding passionately.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am sorry as this will be a bit long. I will try to explain concisely. I am a 40 year old male, and I weigh 100 kg and 1.85 m tall. I have toxoplasmosis. Last year, I had a weird throat ache, like a persistent itch on the upper side of my left palatine tonsil. It is hard to describe, but it felt like having a stray bit of food stuck there. Over the course of a few weeks, it grew more and more painful, with pain radiating into the left ear and swollen lymph nodes on left side of my neck. So, I went to my doctor. He noticed an irritation there, and said it could be gastric reflux, and prescribed Esomeprazole, which had no effect. We tried some antibiotics, again without result. Other symptoms were mild fever and fatigue.So, after a month, I went to see an ENT specialist. This is when the fun starts. He examined my throat with an endoscope, saw nothing, and said it was gastric reflux. I told him I was a smoker, and he replied that for my peace of mind, we could take some time to figure it out and scheduled an endoscopic lung examination. A procedure which requires general anesthesia, to probe a bit that does not hurt and without doing any kind of non-invasive exam like an x-ray first. I did not do it. However, I did the other exams he wanted like radiography of left sinus and echography of sub-mandibulary gland, both the tests found nothing.The symptoms receded without treatment in the same way they had come, and by two months, everything was gone. And by the end of last year, that itch in my throat came back just like before, and then it became very painful again, with the same scenario. The symptoms were swollen lymph nodes on left side of the neck, mild fever (38°C), and fatigue. I also got muscle aches in various places, mostly left arm and left side of the chest muscles. So during the start of this year, I went back to see that specialist. He looked at my throat again, and he found nothing. So, he told me maybe it is psychosomatic, but I should still do an MRI just in case.I went back to my doctor and started from scratch. We did a throat swab, which was normal. The blood test showed toxoplasmosis IgG 2.8 IU/mL and toxoplasmosis IgM 3.25 IU/mL. Everything else was normal, and I do not have HIV, Lyme, hepatitis A, B, or C, and thyroid hormones are normal. So, I have toxoplasmosis, which according to my doctor, explains all the symptoms except the throat ache, which is very worrying. He says I should still do the MRI. I went to see another ENT who said toxoplasmosis also explains the throat ache, and I should not worry. He told me not to do the MRI. He also told me I had reflux, so I stopped worrying. Does toxoplasmosis and acid reflux explain all the symptoms? Should I do that MRI? Or perhaps do other tests?I smoked from age 25 until last year. I quit for six months, then smoked again for six months, and now just quit again, hopefully for good. Also, I used to drink alcohol in unreasonable quantities at night with friends, but I stopped that too. Since then, I have learned that cigarette and alcohol are a risk of amygdala cancer, but I probably have not got that. Still, it is a good reason to get rid of unhealthy habits. I gained 20 pounds last year after quitting smoking. And lost them with a bit of cycling and a little diet. Right now, I am in a general good shape except a bit of a stomach. When I used to cycle a lot, my rest heart rate was 55 bpm. I had too much work recently to exercise properly, so I am around 70 to 75 bpm right now, and my blood pressure is normal. Thank you for your time.", "faq": "Does toxoplasmosis and acid reflux explain all my symptoms?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,My doctor whom I had been visiting discontinued her practice. I found a new doctor with whom I am having problems. The doctor diagnosed me with diabetes 24 years ago when I was 39. I was tried on a couple of different types and dosages of pills, but I cannot remember the names and was eventually placed on insulin. Currently, on Lantus and NovoLog. I asked her several times which type I have and she said it was type 1. She got me through a pregnancy at age of 39 and also approximately five years ago I was hospitalized with ketoacidosis. Shortly after my pregnancy, I was diagnosed and treated for Graves disease and I am currently on Synthroid. After having to select a different doctor, he said I could not possibly be type 1 since I was 39 and that I was type 2. He wanted me to stop insulin and try Metformin. I said no to stopping insulin but would add Metformin if he wanted to see what it would do. I took it for one month but I could not tolerate it due to GI issues and refused to continue it. My last A1c was 7.2 one month ago but frankly, I thought it would be higher since the last six months dealing with my mother's Alzheimers and getting her into a nursing home and father getting sick and dying recently and dealing with Medicaid insurance issues with both parents. Things are now beginning to settle down. A1c prior to this last one, six months prior was 6.7. I looked at my lab report in the electronic medical record and am concerned about my kidney function. He told me last year that my kidneys looked fine but the labs show a GFR of 57.51. A repeat GFR in six months was 59.41. He has not mentioned kidney function since. Is not this indicative of chronic kidney disease stage 3? What should I do about it? The previous doctor did put me on Enalapril Maleate, not for hypertension but to help the kidneys. He keeps wanting to stop it since my blood pressure is 90/60. It has always been that as long as I remember.I am also having trouble with not knowing when I am hypoglycemic.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,My complaints started 22 years back, light feeling in the head, cramped neck and chest, hypochondriacal thoughts about heart disease (which I do not have). This caused several panic attacks and anxiety and finally chronic fatigue. My doctor prescribed Paroxetine 20 mg and after some extra anxiety, I was practically free of problems for 20 years and lived a wonderful life.Six months ago after a long period of bad sleep and insomnia, I became anxious again with panic attacks and this time along with negative obsessive thoughts about breathing (not able to stop thinking about breathing), so severe that I cannot function in a normal state anymore. My doctor, the general practitioner, upped the dose of Paroxetine from 20 to 30 mg, but it caused a strong adverse reaction. I became very emotional and unstable, not able to sleep and very restless and racing thoughts. I have had the 30 mg dose over a period of 8 to 9 weeks to see if the symptoms went away and my situation improved, but it did not. So I am back at 20 mg again.The extreme adverse effects have eased it but I still have obsessive thoughts about my breathing. This is going on dozens or many times a day and is causing so much anxiety. The bottom line is that I am aware of my breathing and is afraid to get rid of this thought, but I think it is fed by general anxiety, because when I take a Benzo or sleeping aid later in the day, the obsessive thoughts are gone. This now controls my life and I am unable to cope. It is also mentioned under the name sensorimotor obsession. In my opinion, this is a kind of OCD, but the basis lies in general anxiety. This breath OCD also manifested itself 21 years back when I first took the Paroxetine, but after a while went away and never brought so much anxiety.Now my question is whether this is caused by Paxil poop out or tachyphylaxis although the upped dose did not work. And what to do, augment the Paroxetine with Buspar to try to fight the possible Serotonin depletion? Or switch to another SSRI or SRNI? Or TCA?

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old female and overall in good health. Starting last month quite suddenly, I started having insomnia issues. The symptoms were difficulty to fall asleep, sensations of adrenaline, waking up scared when falling asleep, a sensation of weakness or numbness in both arms, mental agitation, restless legs syndrome, falling asleep late, waking up several times per night, unable to get back to sleep and having very vivid dreams. I just felt very weird altogether. I had this pretty bad for about a week last month then starting feeling a bit better with just one to two wakes during the night usually around 4 to 5 a.m.At the end of last month, I started taking melatonin supplements before going to bed, around 1.5 mg before going to bed and it made me sleep very well. I fell asleep within 40 minutes of taking it and then sleeping well throughout the night. Yesterday, I stopped the melatonin since I did not think I was supposed to take it for a long time and I had a horrible night. I woke up six to seven times, staying awake between 10 to 40 minutes each time, dreaming very vividly, being aware that I am dreaming while asleep, did not feel like I managed any deep sleep at all. I do not know what exactly is the matter with me. I am now fearing sporadic fatal insomnia and that is not helping things at all. I feel very distressed now.A bit about my context. I am a mother of a 1-year-old who sleeps in the same room with me, but he sleeps well throughout the night. I do check him whenever I wake up from sleep. I have done that since he was born but only had insomnia in the last one to two months. I am a bit stressed with all the work involving staying at home with the small child but nothing extreme.Last summer, I started having migraine with an aura all of a sudden during the stresses of starting solids and having to employ my non-existing cooking skills. I had an MRI and an angiogram and it was clear. I was diagnosed with migraines with aura and had a few of them for a few months and then they seemed to have stopped two months later. In the last three to four months, I also started having occasional hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations with visual patterns appearing, pulsating with my own pulse and.or rotating my vision. I can only see them when there is dark and they disappear in about 5 to 20 minutes.I also have autoimmune hyperthyroidism, which only occasionally acts up. I have had this for 13 years.I only take medications when my thyroid acts up. I never had insomnia with this condition and I do not feel like being hyperthyroid at the moment with normal pulse, not a lot of anxiety, no panic attacks, not losing weight but I will check it tomorrow just in case. However, even if I am hyper, I would still not be sure the insomnia is related to that since I never had insomnia as a result of my thyroid condition.I have no one in my family with fatal insomnia, but my mother did have insomnia as a result of her anxiety and depression. This started when she was over 40. I do not have depression and have only mild anxiety related mainly to this new onset insomnia.First of all, can this be sporadic fatal insomnia because this scares me a lot during the night?Also, can this be some sort of psychosis or whatever? Something neurological?During the day, I feel and function normally. Today I do feel especially shaken up and feel unusual. What else can this be?Is the melatonin working well for me?What should I do? Any advice?", "faq": "Why do I have sleep problems when not on melatonin supplements?"},

Could you please give me some advice on how to treat these symptoms, which I could pass on to my regular doctor.First is the Raynaud's phenomenon, this is not crucial as I do not experience this as much anymore, making sure my hands are always kept warm. But, if you have any other suggestions I would like to hear them. The one symptom that I am most concerned with is the generalized edema. It has started about 4 years ago and has gotten severely worse. Since then, I have been prescribed diuretics from my doctor. But, whenever I take them I will go through a process of losing about 10-15 lbs in water weight, then after a week of no drug or diet change, I used to go back to the same state as I was before taking the diuretics and sometimes much worse.My doctors and I think that this may be due to my capillaries being leaky and this leaking protein might surround the body tissue area. When I take the diuretics, my body flushes out the water, but at the same time the protein in the area senses a loss of water and sucks in more from my bloodstream by replacing the water I had just lost. However, my doctors are not quite entirely sure that, if this is, in fact, the root problem with water retention.I have kept a very strict diet when it comes to sodium and other things of that nature. Anything of a personal nature that comes to solving this problem that I have tried, have had no successful outcomes. I wanted to know if this is a case you have seen in many other patients with an autoimmune disease, especially the patients with systemic sclerosis. If it is so, is there any effective treatments for the water retention other than diuretics? Is there anything that I can recommend my doctor that will aid me in dropping this water weight and keeping it off?", "faq": "I was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I will be honest and say this is primarily for reassurance from a fear of esophageal and stomach cancer as I suffer very badly from chronic hypochondriasis, for which I am getting treatment for in the form of CBT and on Venlafaxine 225 mg. I am a 43 year old male. I was a social smoker till my 30 years of age and nothing since. I watch my alcohol intake and had 6 months of abstinence in the 1st half of last year. I am 5'11, 12 stone and active.Over 8 years, I have occasionally got food stuck, normally chicken or steak when I have been shoveling it down. Three years ago I got a piece of steak stuck and had to go to A and E. This was eventually removed with the aid of a gastroscope and was embarrassingly very large. As part of this, they noticed some inflammation and took a number of biopsies as the doctor suspected I had eosinophilic esophagitis. However, they all turned up completely clear. I was prescribed 20 mg Omeprazole. Last year, following a fear I had seen blood in the stool, I got very anxious and ended up having a colonoscopy. This was also completely clear. This year during Christmas, I over indulged a little and on Christmas day got a piece of turkey temporarily stuck, although some water got it down. For some reason though I then began convincing myself I had esophageal cancer or even stomach cancer. This has lead to a number of follow on symptoms like a bit of pain behind my breastbone, belching, getting obsessed with swallowing my own spit and becoming more anxious. I went to see my GP. I explained her all my above symptoms though no vomiting, weight loss, cough, etc. She did a very thorough physical examination, felt for obstructions, tapped my chest cavity and listened to my stomach gurgling. After all of these she said there was absolutely no risk of me having esophageal cancer and told me to up the Omeprazole for a month and relax, then see her again then. However, I am still scared I now have stomach cancer as I do not think any biopsies were done in that area. Please can you provide me with reassurance that I do not have stomach or esophageal cancer?", "faq": "How to get reassured that I do not have stomach cancer?"},

I also noticed a red spot. So, I am hoping it is not speckled leukoplakia. I did get a VELscope done which was fine. I have an appointment for a brush biopsy but that says not 100 percent. Do you think I should get the brush done or wait to have a real one because the brush biopsy removes the leukoplakia and then it will not be there to get a real one?

After that, I started to notice muscle twitching, in every muscle.At first, I thought it was a heart issue but after seeing three cardiologists the results were the same, my heart is fine. Then of course, I Googled it and I see some scary diseases like ALS. I went to a neurologist who, after some questions and examination said that it was due to an anxiety issue. To be sure he sent me to an institute specializing in the detection of neuromuscular disease, a neurophysiologist did a clinical examination (strength, reflex) and an EMG, and no abnormalities was showed, it were before three months.A month later, as my twitching was still going on, I went to another neurophysiologist, he did another EMG and again everything was normal.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I saw an ophthalmologist for what I thought was a pink eye infection. The following issues were addressed: Acute (sudden onset) inflammation of the conjunctiva (the membrane that covers the white part of the eye) causing the white part of the eye to become red and irritated with the formation of little bumps inside of the inner eyelid and misalignment of the eyelashes which rub against the eyeball causing irritation. His diagnosis was some type of scleritis. He wrote a prescription for drops with an antibiotic and told me to give it a few weeks to clear up and nothing serious.Within a month there was little marked improvement so I went to see him again. He was amazed that there was no improvement and laughed. He said all of my patients get better with this medicine except you. You should probably check with the pharmacy and see if this was a bad batch. Maybe it got too hot on the truck. I was literally taken back.He took me off of that medicine and told me to get over the counter drops similar to No More Tears, I did and used for one more week with no improvement. I called his nurse at his office and he prescribed Prednisolone acetate drops which did seem to eliminate the white blisters on the white of my eye. However, my eye started to hurt as if someone was stabbing it with a needle over and over at random times. By the next day morning, I lost a part of my vision in my left eye. It was as if someone smeared my lens with vaseline, blurry and looked like I was looking through frosted glass, and also painful. I called his office and he was on vacation so they referred me to the physician on call at another facility. The doctor was shocked that this had gone on for so long. He was afraid my vision was in danger because of nontreatment. He diagnosed me with dendritic keratitis and shingles of the eye (cornea).He did not want me going back to the previous doctor. I have been with him since trying to get this fixed. He prescribed me the shingles medicine Valtrex. The shingles in the eye are getting better now but the damage which could have been prevented has taken its toll. My left eye is left with a smear, haziness, fog or frost vision which makes it impossible to focus especially with both eyes open. I asked him about a possible cornea transplant and he said the damage was likely too deep in the eye to make a difference. In fact, that could even make it worse. Is this true?I now see two blurry red light traffic signals covered in frost or haze. He said the haze would be permanent. My wife and I are almost retired and wanted to travel before this happened.

{"chq": "Hi doctor,This is not a medical issue, but I have not found any articles that could help me on. I have a very strong sexual and romantic attraction for my partner, and I consider our relationship to be healthy. I also have a very strong kink for being insulted and degraded in bed. The thing is my partner refuses to say anything that shows dominance, let alone insult, because he is too respectful. I love that he is respectful of me, but I resort to thinking thoughts of myself to try to make myself orgasm and even that is not nearly as effective as I think him saying it would. What I am asking for is advice on how to make him feel more comfortable doing this in bed. He enjoys being on top so he is not really the submissive type to begin with.In case this is helpful, here is the information on our relationship outside sex. He is a quiet and passive one. I am the loud and assertive one. Despite this, I take care in making sure that he gives me his thoughts and feelings on things in general and never try to pressure him into anything. However, he has a tendency to do what he thinks would make me happy because he feels obligated except in bed, else I would not be here. For example, he watched a movie with me that he did not like, because he felt he had to. A slightly bigger example is that I expressed interest in taking couple's Latin dance class once we were on our own together and he hates dancing, but says he wants to do it for me, even though I told him I only want to do it if he really wants to. The one thing I say I probably dominate him in is that if I do not think he eats enough or is on his phone too much during lunch, I nag him, sometimes take the phone away and even more seldom spoon feed him. He is very laid back though, and never expressed strong distaste for my being on his case about this. This is a small aspect of our relationship though.", "faq": "I feel bad for my dominant behavior with my husband. Please advise."},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I wanted to get your opinion on my situation to see if you guys might be able to help. For several years now, I have had trouble with smiling fully in certain situations. Generally, in social situations, it is almost like I give an awkward half-smile. It is hard for me to smile fully. This does not really occur when I am alone, only when I am in a social setting around people. Needless to say, I also suffer from OCD, which seems to have gotten worse over the years. But it really just involves me checking things several times.The smile issue is affecting my life way more. However, I want to know if it is more of a physical thing or a mental thing. What leads me to believe it is physical, is that I have tried exercises like smile practice, in which I hold a smile in the mirror for about five minutes. About three minutes in of holding the smile, I feel a tightness in the cheeks area, and then right after that my smile feels normal, almost as if I have released tension in a muscle or something. This does work, but constantly having to do this multiple times a week is super annoying. This led me to look into Botox, specifically the DAO procedure, which essentially freezes up the depressor angularis oris muscle in the face, which prevents frowning, and allows people to smile a lot easier. I went to two local cosmetic surgeons, but they said they were not too familiar with this procedure, and that they felt that it might work or might not, but did not feel comfortable doing it.This problem is really ruining my life and has been for years. Being able to only give a half smile in social situations is embarrassing and something that everyone notices. This often leads me to take MDMA in social situations, which makes me really happy, and not care about my smile. However, I know that I ca not keep doing this. It is not a sustainable way to cope with this issue. I wanted to get your thoughts on my situation. Thanks.", "faq": "In social situations, I give an awkward half-smile. Will Botox help?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, eight months back, after suffering severe headaches. I have never had headaches in my life, except very occasional tensions headaches. I have been taking Warfarin ever since, and I had a follow-up MRI, four months back. The radiologist report says there is an improvement in previously seen dural venous thrombosis, with residual nonocclusive filling defects within the superior sagittal sinus and torcula, and extending into the proximal right transverse sinus. Initially, after having been placed on Warfarin, my headaches pretty much went away. I have, however, woken up in the morning with the occasional bad headache. I was confused as to why this would happen, so I did some reading to find out that headaches could continue for quite some time due to scar tissue. What confuses me about this is that if it is scar tissue, then the scar tissue is always there. In that case, why would the headaches come and go? I spoke to my doctor almost two weeks ago, because Acetaminophen does not help the headaches, and they can sometimes be quite painful. At the time of our conversation, I had a headache that lasted three days. However, in the past week, I have had three headaches bad enough that I have had to take prescribed Vicodin for them.The headache that I had this morning came on in the middle of the night, and I resisted taking medication for as long as possible. I did take Vicodin, but I still have pain. Is it normal for me to still be having severe headaches six months into treatment? And I have five children to care for, and my husband works out of town most of the time. The headaches, while not completely debilitating, makes it difficult for me to go about my normal duties.

{"chq": "Hello doctor, I got liposuction surgery last month. I was in the hospital for two days and then I was discharged. I come from a small town so I had to go a bit far from my hometown for the surgery. My doctor claims that he has 22 liters of fat removed from my body. My bodyweight before surgery was 90 kgs and post-surgery it was around 79. I got liposuction in my thighs buttocks abdomen and arms. I searched online and it says that this much amount of fat removal from one surgery is not healthy. To give an idea of my BMI my height is 5'2. The problem is it is already 21 days since surgery, and I have one of the drains which my surgeon kept open still draining, it started to drain post 7 days of surgery and it is on the back of my right thigh, and this is the third that opened since surgery but the two drains have already closed and clean, I still have swelling all over my body and I am facing a bit of problem in walking normally. Because of the lockdown in my city I am unable to meet my surgeon and get post-op care, but he suggested that any general surgeon can help me so I consulted a general surgeon in my town and he said everything is fine. Also, I have skin necrosis on my left thigh. I do not know what I should do?

{"chq": "Hi doctor,About five weeks ago, I started feeling some weakness in my left leg. I have consulted my family doctor and a neurologist. All physical tests showed no actual weakness. There were no other clinical signs and the reflexes were also normal. There is no activity or movement that I cannot do. When I run, I feel normal. The sensation has persisted and is difficult to describe. Sometimes it feels like weakness, but sometimes like an ache down my leg, particularly when I sit down for a longer period of time and then I feel sore on my lower left back, just above by buttocks. Overall, if I had to describe the sensation in my left leg, I will describe it as a sense of weakness. Apart from the persisting feeling of weakness, I have also noticed muscle twitches all over my body, including my left foot and primarily in both my legs. I know I have been aware of these for years, but I have been more aware of them lately. Every morning for the past three to four weeks, my left foot feels tight, a slight pain when I am walking. But, it does not persist all day and if I do not think about it, then it feels normal. If I do think about it, then it feels as if I am going to have foot drop, although it does not actually happen. On top of this, I frequently feel a sense of vibration at the bottom of my left foot particularly when lying or sitting down. It is hard to tell whether this is a spasm or numbness or tingling. In the past two weeks, I have had two periods of probably two to three days where I have felt cramped and tightness in my left leg particularly at the top of my left calf.I have had a brain MRI, which came back as normal. I have had a left knee ultrasound performed which shows a varicose small saphenous vein and my family doctor does not believe this explains my symptoms. Furthermore, I have had a lumbar CT which returned the following results. At L5-S1 moderate broad left paracentral disc protrusion mildly distorting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and abutting without displacing the traversing nerve roots. Minor disc extension into the foramen at this level without exiting L5 nerve root impingement. Minor changes in the other levels also as described. However, again, my family doctor does not believe this is the cause of my symptoms. He maintains it is most likely from anxiety. I am a 21 year old medical student and to be completely honest, I made the mistake of initially looking up my symptoms online. I have been very anxious since I started experiencing the sense of weakness, as I am worried about the possibility of having ALS. I have constantly been stretching my legs and trying to test my left leg as a result. What is your recommendation? Also, could you please include what you think of the possibility of ALS, as this is my biggest concern at the moment. Thank you so much for your time.", "faq": "How can I rule out ALS?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,Last year, I moved to a coastal area to go to college. I moved into an older house that had really poor ventilation. As a result, when it was warmer inside than outside, I had condensation on my walls and water beaded down. So, soon after I moved in, mold grew on three of my bedroom walls. I had to clean the walls every week with bleach. During this time, I began to get rashes and eczema on my hand and on my legs. They were constantly dry and itchy and I unconsciously itched them until they bled. Seven months later, I also had extremely dry skin around my right eye which was red and itchy. I unconsciously rubbed the area which caused it to become inflamed and become swollen to the point it affected my vision a bit. To treat my rashes, I applied cream to my legs and hands every few hours. For my eye, I applied cream every hour and got eye drops. I also tried Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream 0.5% on my hands. I had a rash from poison oak previously. This prescription cream prevented the itchiness but caused it to dry out enough to start peeling, cracking and bleeding. So I stopped using the prescription cream and just used a regular cream for all my rashes.After about a week of using cream, the skin around my eye returned to normal but I had to still apply cream to ensure it did not dry out and peel.The problem is that I still have a huge rash on my hand and up and down my legs. It has gotten extremely bad as I constantly have scabs or bleeding wounds on my legs from itching or they have puss oozing out. For the past couple weeks, I have been waking up five to six times before my alarm to find I am itching my rashes. Now the rashes seemed to have spread as well. They began on my lower legs and have since spread to the entirety of my legs. My hand rashes started small the size of a penny. Now it is the size of a dollar coin. It also seems to have spread up to my wrist and maybe starting on my other arm as well.I thought of many what could be the cause of my rashes but I do not have many ideas.Could it be an allergic reaction to the mold from my walls because it started during this time? But, I still have the rashes almost a month after the mold had stopped growing. The mold spores could still be on the walls or the environment.Could I be allergic to the cream? I have used this cream for the past two or three years.Could I be allergic to the shampoo or the soap? I have had the same bottles for past nine months, two months before the rashes started.Could I be allergic to bed sheets? I have the same bed sheets for the past seven months.Could I be allergic to food or milk? I cook all my food and have not had any steady foods that I had not already been eating before. I thought maybe I could be lactose tolerant. Of note, my both parents are and it started around the time they were in college so I cut out dairy for two weeks, but nothing changed.Could it be allergies to pollen? I thought maybe I was allergic to the mold in the winter and now that it was spring, I was allergic to pollen. But I have no symptoms of allergies than the rash.Can it be due to dirtiness? I normally shower once every two days. I tried showering daily for two weeks, but no change in the rashes.Am I allergic to the new place? I went back to my old place some time back for spring break. The week I came back to the new place, my rashes had stopped itching and seemed to be healing completely. The rashes returned the second week when I was back.Can it be due to dryness due to heaters and the winter weather? The heaters were always on in the winter and I had to remoisturize all my skin more often. The weather is now much warmer and heaters are not turned on anymore but I still have the rashes.I have now had the rash on my hand for six months. I have had the dryness around my eyes for three months. I have had rashes on my legs for almost seven months. I plan to go to see a doctor but I have to wait until I return home.Attached below are three pictures; my eye when it is dry and peeling, my hand rash, and the back of my knee where it usually itches the most.Can you please tell me what I could do to help fight these rashes?", "faq": "Are my rashes an allergic reaction to the molds on the walls?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,My 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed with various mental disorders since the age of 2. My parents have taken her to doctors since then because they have noticed that she was not developing like the other children. Almost every doctor gave another diagnostic such as autism (each doctor suggested a different type of autism) and mental retardation. When she was approximately 6 years old, she was also diagnosed with epilepsy.At first, the crisis was happening only while sleeping and they were detected during an EEG by a doctor. He prescribed the first anti-epileptic drug which was Ospolot. My sister felt very sick from it so another doctor told us to stop the medication. We did and then she started having a different type of crisis, absence crisis while awake. The doctor then prescribed Topram. Throughout the treatment with Topram, another type of crisis was added beside the absence, that is myoclonus. The doctor then prescribed Depakine instead of Topram.The absence crisis stopped, but the myoclonus stayed. Besides Depakine, she started taking Rivotril as well. With this combination, she stopped having a crisis for 3 months, but then the myoclonus started again and nocturnal epilepsy crisis was added as well. During this period, the doctor tried to replace Depakine with Lamictal (Lamotrigine), but my sister became intoxicated from it and started suffering from the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She had to be at the hospital for one week to detox. My parents went to a different doctor then and he added Topram (Topamax / Topiramate) besides Rivotril and Depakine. This did not work again. My sister felt very sick from this combination while having a crisis both while being awake and asleep. She was then prescribed Depakine and Levetiracetam. The crisis while being awake stopped, but those while asleep still happen. At the moment, she takes Depakine, Levetiracetam, and Ospolot, but the nocturnal crisis persists.We do not know what to do anymore because the side effects of all these anti-epileptics have done a lot of damage. My sister is always very sleepy and drooling all the time. She already has mental issues so this just makes things so much worse.I know I wrote a lot, but I thought you should have as much information as you can. Here in our place, doctors are not that well informed about these diseases, so they do not really know how to deal with it. We also cannot afford to go to other countries anymore to check with other doctors.

When I say scared, I mean night terrors, huge anxiety, and no appetite (lost 15 pounds in three weeks). I cannot work and it is all I think about. The circumstances are as follows. I performed oral sex on a female. I then fingered her and then masturbated myself with the same hand. I have asked a few professionals and they say I am only at risk theoretically but have no real risk of contracting HIV. However, my body tells me differently. I have had a sore throat for 20 days, no appetite, pain where my liver and spleen are, weakness in my legs that come and go and a hint of nausea every now and then. I have night sweats that awaken me but they are accompanied by panic. My heart feels like it is going to burst. My tongue and mouth burn, but I think that is acid-related because my breath is awful, no matter how much I brush. I had an Alere combo HIV test at 25 days and that was negative. I have never had a fever, rash, swollen nodes, or any of the common symptoms. My questions are what is my real risk of contracting HIV? The health department said I do not need to retest and that 25 days was enough time for accurate results with that type of test. Is that true?

Last year I had undergone angiography as an age-based test and symptom of pain on starting walking short distance a few meters. Many times it does not, in a mid-thoracic area of the upper back and epi-gastro area. But things were seen normal except for a small branch which was 100 % clogged but the cardiologists said it does not matter. This problem of feeling pain when walk some meters started four years back. It is surprising that if I jog stationary position for even two minutes no pain. Now since a few days when I lie down on the bed also the pain starts but not in sitting position. So an MRI was recommended and I underwent MRI of the spine with contrast.

Generalized spondylotic changes were seen in form of osteophytes and disc desiccation at multiple levels seen in the form of loss of hyperintense signal on T2W images.

Generalized spondylotic changes were seen in form of osteophytes and disc desiccation at multiple levels seen in the form of loss of hyperintense signal on T2W images. Diffuse broad-based posterior and bilateral foraminal disc bulge with posterocentral disc protrusion seen at L5/S1 level indenting the thecal sac and compressing bilateral traversing S1 nerve roots.12 years back, I had L4/L5 disc bulge problem stenosis and sciatic nerve type pain in leg left and burning sensation and pinpricks in feet of both legs. I was about to go for surgery but an osteopath corrected this with manipulations for 5 to 6 days and signs abated. Till then this part is fine.

The gallbladder wall is minimally prominent. However, the gallbladder is collapsed. All of my laboratory blood work showed that my kidney, liver and pancreas functions are normal. The gastroenterologist did not really give me any insight. He said to find a surgeon in case I have another attack, so that the gallbladder can be removed. I have found a surgeon, but I would like to get a second opinion from a different gastroenterologist. I have had a dull ache since the initial attack, but I have not had any more excruciating pain.

{"chq": "Hi doctor, I have gone to see a different dentist after I retire. My first appointment with the new dentist, they took x-rays, and the dental hygienist started to clean my teeth. She noticed an excess cement that was from my crown procedure a couple of years ago and stated that it had to be removed because it is irritating the gum in between my crown and my other tooth. By the way, when I was young, they could not save the tooth, so when they extracted it, the tooth or molar next to it started shifting in an angle creating a hole in between the two teeth. Food gets stuck in there, but when my dentist replaced the crown two years ago, I started getting relief. Until now when I went to the new dentist and her dental hygienist told me that she would remove the excess cement. That is where it started going bad and annoying. Food was getting stuck in between the teeth again.My question is, do you think my previous dentist did the crown like that in purpose (putting excess cement to somewhat cover the hole ), or is the dental hygienist right about her findings or diagnosis? Mind you, I did not get examined by the new dentist until after the hygienist cleaned and removed the excess cement. It took her awhile to remove it and my gum was terribly bleeding. I was not hurting, but it was definitely unpleasant. Please advise.", "faq": "Removing the excess filling in a tooth causes gap between tooth and bleeding. Is this normal?"},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am under treatment for OCD and anxiety symptoms. I have had very hard months with extreme anxiety, panic attacks and depersonalization. Now, I am on Duloxetine 60 mg (will stop in the next 7 weeks), Paroxetine 20 mg (will be reduced in the following weeks), Clomipramine hydrochloride 100 mg per day (will be raised to 225 after 4 weeks) and Risperidone 0.5 mg per day. I trust my psychiatrist. She is talented and very experienced. When I talked about my concerns on serotonin syndrome, she told me that it is not going to happen. But, I am still afraid of adverse effects, seizures, etc. I have started Clomipramine hydrochloride 30 mg per day around two weeks ago. Whenever I increase the dosage, the following day my anxiety symptoms increase. Also, I have myoclonus in my feet and hands. It occurs just one time for around 10 to 15 minutes. Do you think that I am in danger by using those combinations of drugs?

{"chq": "Hi doctor,About a month ago, I suddenly noticed a grape size swelling on the top of my right testicle. It is not attached to the testis, but above it towards the top of the scrotal sack. I went to a urologist and he asked me to do an USG. The USG showed a thickened right spermatic cord with cystic areas for about 2 cm x 1 cm. The mass was quite hard and firm. The mass had no pain on pressing it. He gave me Banocide and another antibiotic on a trial basis. The mass did not reduce after two weeks of treatment. Then, he recommended me to do a FNAC. I consulted another doctor and he too was unsure of what it was and recommended immediate surgery to remove it rather than performing a FNAC by saying that it might infect the area. After that I was out of station for a week. When I came back, the hard swelling had miraculously shrunk to the size of less than a pea, but it was still hard. The doctor asked me to observe it for another three weeks and not to go for immediate surgery. Though for the last two weeks the mass does not seem to have reduced any further, I am looking for some advice. What is the possible cause of the problem? I am attaching my USG report as well as a doctor's prescription. I had also done a urine culture and CBC about two months back and the results were normal.", "faq": "Should I continue Banocide for a swelling on the testicle?"},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,From more than a year, I have been facing mental health issues. It started with anxiety about developing schizophrenia and feeling detached from things. Since then, I often get periods of extreme anxiety, involuntary mental images of memories, imagination, dreams, and distorted memories. There are periods of time (1 to 2 weeks) when I feel completely fine. Despite my problems, I was able to take my exams, resume work, and have a social life. I have been seeing a psychologist, who tells me I am on the OCD spectrum. I am always scared that I am losing touch with reality.From the past seven days, my symptoms are, I have very vivid dreams, and when I wake up, I am confused as to whether the dream actually happened or not, and it is only after some time that I convince myself that it did not happen. I have an overactive imagination. As a result, I often act out scenarios in my head. When someone says something, I imagine that they will say this or that next, or this will happen next. It is more like an anticipatory imagination. I try to hold my imagination back, as I am scared I will confuse it with reality. For instance, if a person is sitting in the room next to me, I will think that they are probably doing this or talking to someone or I think that this person will probably do this next. This causes me discomfort and panic, as I think that my overactive imagination is causing me to lose my grip on reality. I do know that this is my imagination, but I feel very scared or anxious as to why I imagine stuff like this in the first place.Usually, in the morning, I feel extremely anxious and feel I have lost my grip on reality, so much so that my teeth chatter from morning to afternoon. I keep on getting mental images of distorted memories of the past, imagination, and dreams. I feel extremely unnerved when I get these mental images, as I feel that I should only be getting mental images of things that actually happened. Why is my imagination or dream bubbling up like this? I feel very anxious when I forget the source of these thoughts or images or cannot determine with 100 % surety as to whether this actually happened. These are mundane things. I also get memory problems. This is probably because I am thinking of my mental problems and not paying attention to things. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why I feel like I am losing my touch with reality, as I am not paying attention when people are actually talking to me. I have been getting extreme feelings of deja vu for the past seven days. Sometimes, things or events seem familiar. It is an effort that I tell myself that this is deja vu.Now the positive things are, there is no problem with my work or social life. I am instantly able to point out when I get these mental images or deja vu. There are periods of time (1 to 2 weeks) when I am completely fine. Strangely, these problems are at their maximum in the morning, and by evening I feel completely fine. My psychologist has told me that I am on the anxiety spectrum. I wanted to know whether someone with anxiety can have these symptoms.", "faq": "My overactive imagination is making me lose grip on reality. Please help."},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,My friend is 30 years old. She had a neck schwannoma tumor, and that was completely removed by surgery. Post surgery, my friend could not eat or drink anything. Her voice was hoarse as well. ENT doctor followed up her and noted that her right vocal chord was paralyzed, but not the left. For her feeding, they installed a G-tube in the abdomen to give her feed from as she could not tolerate it through her mouth or nose. The ENT did the micro laryngoscopy and gave her a temporary injection to bring her right vocal chord closer, so her voice improves and encourage water intake. After three days of this procedure, she tried in the evening time to drink water and little by little; she finished half a glass. She has too much gagging that gives her a feeling of choking. When she clears her throat, the gagging looks like super sticky clear glue, and she constantly has it. The next morning she tried to drink water little by little, but she was getting aspiration. So, she got discouraged and depressed to a severe level. It is now 48th day since the removal of her tumor, and there does not seem to be any sign of her swallowing. I want to know if this is temporary or permanent. We got a couple of opinions from doctors that we sent her surgery report to and they think she can recover anytime between three to six months. The doctor who did the surgery is a vascular surgeon, and he also believes that she will recover from two to three months and will start eating and drinking slowly.I have asked the doctor about the nerve damage or cut. He said that he was not sure about the exact nerve, but seemed like a branching nerve. When I asked him if it was 10th or 12th nerve, he said it was the 12th branching nerve. The ENT doctor said 10th nerve, and it can be permanent damage. The vascular surgeon did say that they repaired the nerve and did not leave it like that. She is currently on Lorazepam, Sodium bicarbonate, Cotazym, Tylenol, Centrum and Ranitidine. At this point, I do not know what to believe anymore and what to think. I believe nerve specialists are neurologists and hence, I am here. Any of your help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.", "faq": "My friend got vocal cord problem after neck surgery.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 28 year old male. For the past four years, I have been experiencing hair loss. About two and a half years ago, I started using Finasteride once a week along with a Ketoconazole shampoo 1 % and Lipogaine, which is similar to Rogaine. I would use this only at night usually using about 2 to 2.5 ml total around my temples and at the vertex. The ingredients in Lipogaine are water, propylene glycol, ethanol, minoxidil 5%, azetinol, saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, oleic acid, gamma & alpha linolenic acid, apple polyphenol, biotin, niacin, biotinoyl-tripeptide, phosphatidylcholine vitamin B6 and B12. The treatment was working well, and I grew back some hair, but about four months ago, I started experiencing a drastic increase in hair loss. I would wake up in the morning after applying the Lipogaine, and my hair would be extremely dry, brittle and stiff which would cause it to fall out very quickly. Around the same time, I developed a circular rash on my forehead which I received while doing cardio at an unhygienic gym. I went to the gym with no rash and left the gym with a 2 inch rash on my forehead. I went to see a dermatologist who told me it was seborrheic dermatitis but he thought it was weird that it took a circular shape on my forehead.Around the same time, my overall activity level dropped as well. I was much less active although I still go to the gym every day. I would go to bed late around 4 AM and wake up at about 12 to 1 PM. I recently switched to regular Rogaine which has shown an improvement as far as my waking up hair quality is concerned, but now I am experiencing scalp dandruff possibly because I am using it twice a day. I also increased my Finasteride usage to two to three times a week. I am still losing hair, but I do believe it has slowed. My hairline has receded since the start, and I feel that I have been losing hair somewhat evenly everywhere on my head except for my sides. Before I believed it to be a hormonal imbalance like a thyroid issue, but lately I am leaning more towards an immune response brought on by the rash on my forehead and my high quantity of Lipogaine usage, which would cause some scalp irritation, along with my lack of daily activity. Also, even though the doctor did not see it, I have noticed occasional small red bumps on my scalp. After using Rogaine for about three weeks, I decided to try the Lipogaine just for a night and got the same dry and brittle hair response as before. Please help. I would love to keep my hair as long as I can, but it is a losing battle right now.", "faq": "Please suggest a treatment for hair loss."},

{"chq": "Hello doctor,This query is for my dad who is 75 years. In the last two months, one week he has been housebound and the initial one month, he was completely bedridden. He slipped twice on the first day. That is how it all started. His right leg could not carry the weight of his body. He is approx 110 kg, 6 feet tall. He has had this problem for the last 30 years but he had never been bedridden and the medication worked. He is also diabetic, taking medication for the heart - Eliquis 2.5 mg to reduce the risk of formation of blood clots and he also has varicose veins.On the first day after this started, he took medication himself as per his last prescription. It did not work and after four days, we called the same doctor home who prescribed Insulin, Zocef CV 500 twice 10 days, Levoflox 500 one a day for 10 days and Daflon twice for 15 days. He said to give it nine days before a follow-up.However, after five days since there was no relief and it had started oozing or edema which he noticed when he was sitting up when two visitors came over. The next day, we called another doctor, a diabetologist, as the previous doctor, then said to visit a vascular surgeon as he could not do anything about the oozing. This doctor completely changed the medicines prescribing Linospan 600 twice, Ceftum 500 twice, Chymoral Forte twice along with two other ointments Nadoxin and Betadine and dressing the wounds. This gave immediate relief. He continued the medication for two weeks till the next follow by the same doctor.By this time, the wounds (characterized by oozing, discoloration, swelling) had completely healed except a small hole at the ankle. This time, the doctor prescribed Doxy 100 twice for two weeks and Orni O twice for seven days along with the same ointments. After the end of two weeks, he continued this for a further 10 days after which he was prescribed Dalacin 300 mg for seven days. He took this for around 12 days. Since the last 10 days, he has been taking his own medication - Zocef CV 500, Levoflox 500 and Daflon and at present, he is back to Dalacin 300 since the last two days.He is averse to being admitted to a hospital for the fear of amputation and because he does not want to be admitted to a hospital. He prefers to be treated at home. 10 days ago, my mom also went to our family doctor, who on seeing the pics of the leg said that as per his opinion it required immediate hospitalization and recommended a color doppler of both lower limbs both arterial and venous. My dad cannot walk to get this test done. Please advice. Especially since he is not able to walk beyond the bed to the dining table and for not more than five minutes.Also, particularly why does the leg get swollen off and on now?

Yes, I know that I am overweight and I am addressing the issue. I recently performed some blood work on myself, so I could have a baseline as I have started a new ketogenic diet. Before 15 days, I ordered a CBC with differential, TSH, lipids panel, CMP, and A1c. The results are as follows (please note that the number in parentheses are the reference range from the laboratory). Hemoglobin A1c - 5.3 (4.8-5.6), TSH - 2.070 (0.450 - 4.500), serum testosterone - 239 (348 - 1197), CBC normal, SED rate - 3 (0-15), Cholesterol total - 214 (100-199), triglycerides - 126 (0-149), HDL - 36 (>39), VLDL - 25 (5-40), LDL - 153 (0-99), CMP normal and serum glucose - 90 (65-99). After I had got these results, I noticed the testosterone was low. I do not have any trouble with erections, though I am not sexually active.I decided to order additional tests, and the results are as follows. Free testosterone - 11.8 (9.3 - 26.5), total estrogen - 88 (40 - 115) and SHBG - 14.1 (16.5 - 55.9). As you can see, my free testosterone is borderline while my SHBG and serum testosterone are all low. My question is besides losing weight, what can I do to naturally and more efficiently to increase my testosterone? Also, are these results indicative of anything more severe?Thank you for your help. I look forward to reading your answer.

My arms and hands are swollen, I have a ring that I used for eight years and used to be loose on my finger, but now I cannot even get it on my finger.I am so fatigue every day, no matter how much sleep I get. My eyes feel heavy, I find myself nodding off at work. I do not ever feel like hanging out with my friends even. I have major mood swings. I cry about things that normally would not make me cry. I get really uncontrollable anger and find myself wondering why I am so angry but I just cannot seem to control it.I have had very little interest in sex with my boyfriend and I live together and we went three months without sex because I just have not had the interest in it, or felt like I do not have the energy to actually have sex. I get occasional tingling in my hands. I will be sitting and doing my makeup and my hands will start to feel a tingle. Or I will be driving to work and my hands will feel almost numb sometimes. I am so thirsty all the time and I am one of those people who drink the recommended amount of water daily.I am now snoring when I sleep which I never have before. And I feel like I sleep so deeply.

But I know that there is new research showing that anything above 2.0 can be considered hypothyroid when there are symptoms associated. My T3 was 246. My FT4 was 1.1 and I have not gotten my anti-TPO antibody back yet. The basic metabolic panel came back fine-kidneys, liver and heart all checked out fine too. My BP was high 154/93 mmHg when I had an ER visit two weeks ago and then again with my PCP ten days ago, but was back to normal 118/69 mmHg in this most recent visit.I am frustrated because I am almost certain it is Hashimoto's, or possibly even Cushing's disease. PCP ran a random cortisol urine test which came back normal, but I know that test is not exactly the gold standard for Cushing's diagnosis. But my PCP seems completely unconcerned and seems to want to diagnose me as depressed or having some other psychiatric disorder that I do not feel is appropriate.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am writing to you in connection with my partner’s allergic reaction which happens when we are together. Basically she is already allergic to dust and has atopy on her right hand since she was a child (now she is 23 and I am 27), which is sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker but always there. As she is a Japanese girl living in Japan, we have met three times in various places, but her symptoms have appeared every time. Small red rashes appear on the hands and later on the legs too. Her face gets itchy and breaks out in pimples too. These always start days after meeting again and get better some days after we leave each other. We also tried sleeping apart and that helped a bit on the symptoms (no sexual intercourse yet).So I am afraid I might have something that makes her produce such reactions. She also blames my dreadlocks which indeed catch not few dust (but I will cut it before we meet soon so that possibility will be crossed out). Because of her dust allergy, they live in a very clean environment so I also suspect that staying longer at an inherently dustier place (like my flat) might get her reactions acting up. Also, she had a lot of stress because of traveling to meet me, which also does not help such skin diseases.In some places, we slept in hotels, so we always suspected the local washing powders to cause these effects but in my work place I deliberately bought a new linen bed to avoid such a problem (although I washed it before using it). Dishes were different in the three countries so I cannot see that there would be a common ground for an allergic reaction.I will buy new clothes and will wash them myself according to her hygienic discipline and we will see how it goes. I do not regularly use deodorant, nor aftershave and I had different shower gels all the time. What else could we change to stop her reactions or to find out what caused them? How could we soothe them? Maybe after being together for a long time she would get used to my flora and she would eventually stop her reactions in an environment with less stress? Of course, I sent her to a specialist as well to get checked (to see whether I can be the cause).", "faq": "How to control atopic red rashes due to dust allergy?"},

The pain goes through the whole eyeball. It feels like deep in my brain. It hurts like hell and I could not sleep. The moment I was finally able to relax my eye from fluttering, a painful vibration would erupt through my eye. I am also extremely sensitive to light.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I have had a sore throat on and off, for the past few weeks. It is not severe, but more of an annoyance with some referred ear pain. This week, I had a family member, who is a nurse, look at my throat to see if it was red or irritated. She noted I had quite a bit of post-nasal drip, but she could see no other issues. I had my tonsils removed as a kid, so they definitely are not the issue. I was thinking this might be caused by allergies, the trees and plants around are starting to bloom. I started taking some Claritin on top of painkillers, earlier this week. I also have been gargling with salt water. Those things seemed to help for a day or two, and the issue seemed to go away.Fast forward to last night, I woke up in the middle of the night with a burning pain in my stomach. This morning the burning pain keeps coming and going, and I can feel a lot of mucus dripping down the back of my throat. Is a burning stomach usually something that can be linked to post-nasal drip? I have never had an issue with acid reflux, so I do not think it is that. Also, the burning sensation is limited only to my lower abdomen.I typically do not have issues with severe allergies, so I am wondering if this could be caused by a virus? To be honest, I do not have a lot of confidence in my local doctor's office, and they tend to order a bunch of tests then overcharge for them. So I am wondering if I can get away with not seeing a doctor. I have ordered an air purifier for my room, and I am taking the allergy medicines religiously. Is there something else I can take or use to alleviate these symptoms? Or should I suck it up and see a doctor? I will also add that with these symptoms, I have had little to no nasal congestion or coughing. Thanks.", "faq": "I have a sore throat, post-nasal drip, and burning pain in my abdomen.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am 54 years old and I have never taken good care of my teeth until a couple of months when I started noticing a very rapid erosion of enamel on my front teeth near the gum line. This area was becoming very thin on a couple of teeth and turning brown and no amount of brushing, cleaning, etc., was making the brown go away.So I went to a dentist for the first time in about 46 years and had a deep cleaning done and a brief consultation. The cleaning got rid of the brown stains but then the brown stains returned within a week on the same thinning areas next to the gum line. I keep brushing and trying different things (a whitener, baking soda, peroxide, a mineralizing toothpaste, avoiding food and drink that causes staining, brushing right after eating) but the staining just continues to get worse and is now happening on all of my front teeth (near the gum line). It has been about three weeks since the deep cleaning and in a couple more weeks I have an appointment with a different dentist who is going to clean them again and hopefully give me some advice on what I can do about this including dental bonding perhaps.My question is, what can I do to get rid of these brown stains and keep them away. Are they just going to keep coming back and getting worse no matter what? Did the deep cleaning somehow cause this to be worse? It seems like it did. Can dental bonding cover these stains and stop them from getting bigger? I have changed my diet also in order to promote healthier teeth. Eating more nutrient foods with more Vitamin D, Magnesium, Vitamin K2, making sure I get enough calcium, using Celtic sea salt instead of regular salt, anything that is known to help promote better teeth and gums.

It was diagnosed as acute otitis media and she was treated with antibiotics such as Lindacin, etc. A week after the completion of antibiotics, again she had the same problem for about three months. Then, the ENT specialist decided to clean the mastoid. Since then, she has been getting fever once in every month. It has been six months now and the 6th time she is taking antibiotics. The blood results are always showing that there is a bacteria, but never detected the location. The fever goes up to 40 and 40.1 degree Celsius. In addition, Paracetamol does not lower the fever and Ibuprofen keeps her only three hours. So, I normally do the rotation with Voltaren. We recently got a strep test for mouth, ear and nose.

{"chq": "Dear doctor,Under a lot of alcohol, I had vaginal intercourse with a lady. I was wasted but I remember that I was protected with a condom. The condom did not break nor leak but maybe was not put perfectly. I did not manage to cum, removed it and masturbated in a very aggressive way with my bare hands for some minutes. She spit twice on my dick, that is all. Since then, I had major symptoms starting from day-2 with burning sensation and painful urination for some days and my genital organ was tender and painful. I took Ceftriaxone and a short course of Ciproxen on my own assuming I had gonorrhea/chlamydia without any test. On day-5 started a very weird tingling numbness in all the limbs which continued for a week or a bit more, sores in mouth on and off starting from the first week including a huge one in the roof of my mouth, headache, low appetite, weakness, and myalgia.Later on, I started to realize changes in the nails after one month, joints pain still ongoing, no fever nor lymphadenopathy, most importantly I lost a lot of pounds and lost appetite and lost weight especially in my face - around the eyes and mouth. I want to mention that I never stopped crying from the very first day of being horrified of HIV. I got psychological and psychiatric consultation several times with no help.Combo fourth generation lab test and syphilis test were performed in a very reliable center and were negative. After eight weeks, the second combo fourth generation test at almost 16 weeks in another major hospital also negative. Can I be a case report of late seroconversion? I am scared to death. Gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and PCR negative as well. Nowadays, I am almost asymptomatic apart from the joint pain that might not be related (got examined by orthopedic who suspects a particular problem) and of course my shrinking face and the changes in my nails which are still there.It seems so far that nothing could reassure me. I admit that there is a psychological or perhaps psychiatric element because of the huge persistent stress. But I must tell you that I always had a big round face and since the event, I lost a considerable amount of facial volume, facial wasting indeed and this was confirmed by a dermatologist. I managed to regain my body weight but not my face. I read online about HIV causing apoptosis of facial fat cells. What is your opinion in that regard?I am only four and a half months from the event. I am really confused. Should I do an HIV viral load test? What are the chances for the duo test to miss twice after the window period? Have you ever heard of or seen a duo turning positive after such a long period? I do not feel like becoming an international case report you know. Thanks in advance. These facial changes what I am experiencing are simply driving me crazy. I want so much to move on with my life but I am losing my face which is my social ID. I do not know how to explain.My relationship with my wife, my social life, and my career are already destroyed and a total mess cause this thing had taken a huge toll on me. So, I am desperate. Again, I am talking about shallowness around and under eyes, temporal wasting, maybe a prominent change in my face contour, much smaller cheeks and some empty holes in my forehead and in my skull just behind my ears. It is just weird. It was not there before, it is advancing and I cannot find any explanation for it apart from the potential relationship with that one-time unfortunate exposure. I asked a couple of national HIV experts and also got a consultation from a doctor. All of them are pretty sure I am HIV negative. The doctor was a bit mad at me even. Please help me. In my country, negative duo test at 12 weeks or after is considered conclusive and definitive.", "faq": "I tested negative for HIV twice. Can I be a case of late seroconversion?"},

{"chq": "Hi doctor,I am a 24 year old female. My BMI is normal. I am fairly active on my feet all day because of work and I used to walk instead of transport. I was a lot more active when I was younger. I used to dance for roughly 20 hours a week and swim five hours a week. Since I have got older and due to injury, I dance for 2 hours a week and swim when I get a chance. I was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatters in both knees when I was 16 and had physio for a year. They used to swell drastically and I still have prominent bony lumps just below both the kneecaps. The only thing that really seemed to help is drastically cutting down exercise as they would become so painful that I could barely walk. The pain comes and goes after an active day at work such as cycling, swimming, driving a long distance or sitting for a long period of time as I am 5'10, it is regular. I have also noticed recently that I have been getting neck and lower back pain as well as regularly feeling like I have strained my right shoulder. I have tried to pass it off as just pain, but it is becoming too often to be a coincidence and cannot help thinking it is linked. I have looked online and read a bit about osteoarthritis and this seems to fit what I have been finding. But, I do not want to jump into conclusion.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,I am a 29 year old, who is 1.83 m tall and weigh about 70 kg. My health problems started two years back, when I had a lot of stomach pains, though they went away quickly once I had a filling meal. After an endoscopy, the doctor observed a large axial hernia as well as moderately pronounced gastritis. I was prescribed PPI, and the problems went away for a while. The effects of the PPI seemed to diminish after a while as the pain returned during nights and while exercising. In the mornings, I suffered from severe heartburn and short-term breathing troubles possibly because stomach acid went into my lungs at night. Over time, I have been prescribed different PPIs like Pantoloc, Esomeprazole, and Pariet, and the dosage always increased.As the symptoms did not improve, the doctors recommended a surgery last year. Beginning of this year, I had a laparoscopic fundoplication. I could not swallow anything, not water or even my saliva, during the first five days after the surgery. The doctors suspected this was due to strong swelling, and I was able to start swallowing again after the sixth day. After the suggested diet phase, I was able to eat almost everything and was very happy about that.Since the end of last month, however, I have had strong symptoms again. I celebrated my birthday by drinking some alcohol the day before it started. The stomach pains, bloating, gurgling noises in my stomach, and most uncomfortably, pain in my lungs started again. The chest pains come mainly when I bend my upper body or when I turn in bed. My primary care doctor prescribed me 20 mg Pantoloc to take for a week, as she suspected gastritis. The symptoms were still present after a week, so the doctor who performed the surgery did another endoscopy. He determined it is a moderately pronounced gastritis and suggested three weeks of PPI therapy.As I was still concerned about the pain in my chest, I also went to a lung specialist, who diagnosed an inflammation of the bronchi, probably caused by the yearlong influence of the stomach acid. He prescribed a Cortisone inhaler, which I have been using for two weeks now. Also, I currently take 40 mg Nexium in the morning and try to take a light diet. The conditions now have lasted for about six weeks already, and I am starting to worry. Can it be anything else? Is it normal that it takes so long? I should have no heartburn after the surgery, right?", "faq": "Why do I still have gastritis problem after a laparoscopic fundoplication?"},

She advised me to wait and allow my body to bounce back to its normal cycle naturally. She said it would take anywhere between few days to three months for my periods to get back to normal. She also prescribed daily contraceptive pills. Anyways, I got my period within six days.Last month as we both had to leave, I did not start the daily contraceptive pill. I took another one ECP and got my periods as normal. As my periods were ending, we had sex, and I took another ECP. My next period was due at the end of the month. However, he made an impromptu flight to see me and happened to come on the day that I was expecting my periods. We had sex on that day. But he did not climax. And since I was due for my periods, I thought I should not take an ECP again because I did not want to mess up my already messed up hormones. However, I did not get my periods. It is 11 days, and I took two pregnancy tests and both tests came negative. Please advise.", "faq": "I have messed up with my pills and missed my periods.

{"chq": "Hello doctor,The primary concern surrounding my inquiry is body pain and fatigue. I have lymphedema in my lower legs since eight years. Intermittently, the condition is mediated with compression stockings, massage therapy and occasional stationary exercise. The swelling persists with activity, just to a lesser degree as long as garments are applied. At this point, there is slight pitting. The tissues from the calves down to the feet are consistently engorged and tough. Extensive rest is required to adjust leg shape from the calves down from columnar to moderately curve. The condition has limited impact on my physical activity and energy. It manifests as pain and hence, there is related slowing down after cardiovascular sports.Before six years, I began experiencing upper respiratory infections several times a year, coinciding with or without any flu or cold, requiring days of rest and OTC medication to recuperate. The timing coincided with a change of place and so, I presumed climate adjustment may have been the culprit. But, the symptoms have persisted ever since, with or without vaccinations. I had signs of anemia since my young age and got to know the diagnosis in after a year following the testing related to a women's wellness examination. A year later, lethargy and moderate pain of the lower extremities became a regular occurrence regardless of the physical activity. The symptoms would subside over time with rest. Migraine pain also emerged that year, seeming to coincide with sinus activity, due to the pain's concentration around the forehead and eyes, and required the use of OTC pain relievers. Migraines had not been a concern prior to that point.Then, the lethargy and body ache became a more persistent fixture, occurring several days a week, weekly, subsiding on its own, regardless of the amount of rest. Last year, the lethargy overwhelmed the physical pain and is remaining at the same frequency, but coupled with a spike in symptoms of anxiety, such as difficulty in concentrating, aphasia, heightened fear around mundane circumstances and nausea. Additionally, during winter a brief exposure outdoors at night resulted in Raynaud's disease in the fingertips of both hands for about a month, until it started to warm outside.Since the beginning of this year, the ongoing fatigue has occurred daily and the body ache occurs throughout the day, regardless of rest or activity. The pain is usually dull all over, but also presents with inflammation around the joints (knees, elbows, wrists and ankles) and muscle soreness primarily of the mid and lower back. Daily use of extra-strength OTC pain reliever is now necessary, though I try to refrain from every day use as much as possible. Dull headache pain, in the front region occurs several times a week, as do issues of concentration and mental fog. Additionally, twice this year I have experienced syncope. I am attaching the results of recent blood work, which was completed during my menses. Previously, I was taking Acetaminophen. Currently, I am taking Aspirin.

My last periods was on the 25th of last month, and I started ovulating on the third of this month, and it ended on the 12th. My husband and I had sex on the fifth. Despite my history of irregular periods, I was expecting them to come this time around the same date as I was put on Cabergoline to control my high prolactin (22 on the last report) for regularity of periods. I did not get periods on 25th, but I did not worry too much, as I could have been late in general. However, I checked pregnancy on 20th of this month, which was negative, but I kept the kit. I checked the pregnancy again on 28th and found it negative again, and kept the kit again.After a few hours, I went back to throw the kits, and I found a very faint line on the 28th one, and checked the other one also and found a very faint line on that also. The one on 20th was more fade than the one on 28th. I thought it is urine or evaporation line, and did not take it seriously. I went to the hospital, and the doctors did not find any gestational sac or ectopic pregnancy in ultrasounds also. Nothing at all. But as I had a faint line, they asked me to come back after 10 days.Yesterday morning, I again did a home pregnancy test. Within 2 to 3 minutes, I got another faint T line. This time it was a bit darker as compared to the previous one. I do not understand what is going on. The doctors said that there is nothing called as false positive if the test is checked within prescribed time frame, and a T line appears only when there is some hCG hormone, however, nothing on the ultrasounds.My all four I-can strips show faint lines, but the Prega news kit does not show anything at all. Complete negative. My ultrasound shows nothing. What could be happening with me? My medications since last month are Cabergoline, Metformin, and Folic acid. The doctors say that it could be too early to say something, or it could be ectopic, which could not be verified in the ultrasounds. Could you please give me some opinion on this, as to what could have been the reasons for faint T line appearing within 2 to 3 minutes, while ultrasounds say I am not pregnant?", "faq": "Why are faint T lines appearing on urine pregnancy tests, while ultrasounds say I am not pregnant?"},

{"chq": "Hello Doctor,I have less dense packed hair with slight thinning in the hairline and on the vertex. I have this condition since 2003.I am applying Minoxidil 5% since 10 years and from 2005 for every single day. My concern is I was diagnosed for Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA), an autoimmune disorder and have been under immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporine 300mg/day for 2 years, since February 2013. Surprisingly, the Cyclosporine has helped controlling further thinning. But now I would like to take at least 0.25mg of Finasteride per day (1/4 of 1mg tablet) for improvement on already thinned areas. When I discussed with my dermatologist whether I could take the  0.25mg Finasteride while I am on 150mg Cyclosporine twice a day, she told that I can take it and there will not be any problem if I take lower dosage of 0.25mg Finateride.Brief note on my PRCA disease history:Actually I was first diagnosed with PRCA in January 2008 with hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL. I was put forth on one and a half years of immunosuppression - Cyclosporine tablets 150mg twice a day till September 2009. When my hemoglobin reached 12 g/dL in September 2009 I was advised by my hematologist to stop the Cyclosporine intake. So, from September 2009 till December 2012 I was doing good with my hemoglobin level 12 g/dL without any immunosuppressants. Suddenly after December 2012 the relapse of PRCA occurred and as of now I have been advised to be on some amount of immunosuppression dosage with the Cyclosporine throughout life to prevent the relapse again. Right now my hemoglobin level is 12 g/dL. I have attached my latest Complete Blood Count (CBC) report. Cyclosporine intake has been reduced to 100mg twice a day at present.  So, I am just continuing to apply the 5% Minoxidil right from 2004 till date without fail. And during the period between September 2009 to December 2012 while I was doing good without any immunosuppressive Cyclosporine medication, I took Finasteride 1mg for a period of 5 months under supervision of my dermotologist. I did not have any sexual side effects except for my semen become more liquid, but my hair thinning improved a lot. Even I had a good amount of new hair growing out on the hairlines, temple and on the vertex. But I stopped Finasteride with fear of possibly having side effects after a long term usage.Could you please advise whether it is safe to start taking 0.25mg of Finasteride now. As I am on immunosuppressant Cyclosporine and have to continue at least minimal dosage throughout life, will 0.25mg of Finasteride have interactions with Cyclosporine or any other adverse effects? Also I had discussion with one of my dermatologists. He advised that I can safely take Finasteride 1mg and Minoxidil-Finasteride are US FDA approved for androgenic alopecia. He also clarified that there is no interaction between Cyclosporine or Finasteride. And when I asked him about Saw Palmetto instead of Finasteride, he replied that though they are claimed to block DHT, there are no clinically proven results. Could you please advise me on this?", "faq": "I have less dense hair and thinning of hair. Will there be any problem while taking Finasteride along with Cyclosporine?"},
